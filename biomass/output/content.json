The agency said the proposed decision results from its review of the pending SRE petitions and supporting information, its legal, technical and policy analysis of the Clean Air Act provisions related to small refineries, and its application of the holding of the . \u00a0A total of , with five SRE petitions pending for compliance year 2021, 30 SRE petitions pending for compliance year 2020, 29 SRE petitions pending for compliance year 2019, three SRE petitions pending for compliance year 2018, one SRE petition pending for compliance year 2017, and one SRE petition pending for compliance year 2016.The Renewable Fuels Association on Feb. 7 expressed strong support for the agency\u2019s proposed action, noting it would restore confidence in the RFS and ensure that SRE program complies with the Tenth Circuit Court\u2019s 2020 decision moving forward.\u201cEPA\u2019s proposed decision is consistent with the statute and with EPA\u2019s repeated determinations that small refineries pass through the cost of RFS compliance to the wholesale prices of their products and therefore do not face disproportionate economic hardship,\u201d wrote Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA in . \u201cWhen finalized, the proposed approach will restore confidence in the RFS program, which in turn will stimulate the increased investment in renewable fuel production that Congress sought to encourage.\u201dRFA also encourages EPA to deny 31 SREs granted by the previous administration for compliance year 2018. Those exemptions were inappropriately issued in 2019 and were recently remanded to EPA by the D.C. Circuit following a legal challenge led by RFA.\u00a0Cooper noted that the congressional goals of enhanced energy security and greenhouse gas emissions reduction have been undermined over the past several years due to the massive increase in SREs. \u201cAmerica\u2019s biofuel producers and farmers have been forced to pay the price\u2014the uncertainty and market instability caused by the surge of exemptions have left them unable to fully benefit from a program intended to increase demand for their products,\u201d he wrote.The American Coalition for Ethanol is also speaking out in support of EPA\u2019s SRE proposal in  submitted to the agency. \u201cACE strongly supports EPA\u2019s proposed decision to deny all pending SRE petitions by finding the petitioning refineries do not face disproportionate economic hardship (DEH) caused by compliance with their RFS obligations,\u201d wrote Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE.ACE\u2019s comments provide background on the litigation that compels EPA to deny the pending SREs, including precedent established by the Tenth Circuit Court in\u00a0which ACE was a petitioner on, and subsequent decision by the Supreme Court in . EPA\u2019s proposed denial of all pending SRE petitions complies with the Tenth Circuit Court ruling in that: 1) The cause of refinery \u201chardship\u201d must be the RFS, rather than general economic factors; and 2) EPA\u2019s determination that RFS compliance costs are essentially a pass through that are not ultimately born by refiners prevents RIN prices from being used to justify waivers.ACE is also encouraged EPA proposed to evaluate future SRE petitions based on these two restraints.Clean Fuels Alliance America also supports the EPA\u2019s SRE proposal. \u201cClean Fuels supports EPA\u2019s proposal to deny 65 pending small-refinery exemption petitions and requests that EPA also deny the 36 small-refinery exemptions\u201431 of which were originally granted\u2014for 2018,\u201d wrote Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs at Clean Fuels. The 36 additional petitions pending before the agency are those remanded by order of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in response to EPA\u2019s motion in\u00a0\u00a0and consolidated cases.Clean Fuels estimates that the 2018 exemptions reduced demand for biodiesel and renewable diesel by 190 million gallons. Overall, the exemptions that EPA granted beginning in 2017 impacted 550 million gallons of biomass-based diesel, resulting in 5.2 million metric tons of additional greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cIf EPA were to grant the pending 2019 small refinery exemptions, we estimate that biodiesel and renewable diesel will experience a future market loss of approximately 200 million gallons, resulting in 1.9 million MT of GHG emissions in the atmosphere that could have otherwise been avoided,\u201d Kovarik continued.\u201cEPA\u2019s denial of pending small refinery exemptions is not just appropriate, but required,\u201d Kovarik added. \u201cClean Fuels and its members appreciate the administration\u2019s commitment to getting the RFS back on track. We urge EPA to finalize the volumes quickly, account for small refinery exemptions fairly, and grow the market for biofuels through a timely rule for 2023 and beyond.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

According to the BEIS, the program aims to support the development of innovative hydrogen BECCS technology solutions across three categories. The first is feedstock pre-processing, focused on the development of low-cost, energy and material efficient technologies that will optimize biomass and waste feedstocks used in advanced gasification technologies. The second is the development of advanced gasification technology components. The BEIS described advanced gasification technologies as those that can be used to convert biomass or waste into aviation fuel, diesel, hydrogen, methane and other hydrocarbons. The third is the development of novel biohydrogen technologies that can be combined with carbon capture. The BEIS offered dark fermentation, anaerobic digestion and waste water treatment as some of examples of these novel technologies.The program is broken down into two phases. In the first phase, successful applicants will receive funding to develop their hydrogen BECCS innovation, demonstrate its feasibility and prepare project plans. Projects selected for phase one funding are eligible to apply for phase two, which will support a physical demonstration of the hydrogen BECCS technology.Phase one applications are due March 4.

    "text": "Representatives of the U.S. biofuels industry on Feb. 4 called on the U.S. EPA to abandon plans to reduce the 2020 Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligation (RVO) and urged the agency to set strong RVOs for 2021 and 2022.A variety of groups, including those representing the ethanol industry, renewable natural gas (RNG) industry, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers were among those who filed public comments regarding the agency\u2019s proposed rule to revise the existing 2020 RVO and set the long-overdue RVOs for 2021 and 2022.The EPA  on Dec. 7, along with a separate proposed action in which the agency proposes to deny more than 60 pending small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions. The comment period on the RVO proposed rule closed Feb. 4, while the comment period on the proposed SRE actions is open though Feb. 7.For 2020, the EPA is proposing to reduce the total RVO for renewable fuel to 17.13 billion gallons, down from 20.09 billion gallons\u00a0. The nested RVO for advanced biofuel would be set at 4.63 billion gallons, down from 5.09 billion. The RVO for biomass-based diesel would be maintained at 2.43 billion gallons, while the cellulosic biofuel RVO would be set at 510 million gallons, down from 590 million gallons. The agency said it is proposing to revise 2020 RVOs to account for challenges the program and the market faced during the year, including from the COVID-19 pandemic.For 2021, the EPA is proposing to set the RVO for total renewable fuel at 18.52 billion gallons, including 5.2 billion gallons of advanced biofuel, 2.43 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel, and 620 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel. The EPA said the 2021 RVOs are being proposed at the level the agency projects the market will use by the end of this year.For 2022, the EPA is proposing to set the RVO for total renewable fuel at 20.77 billion gallons, including 5.77 billion gallons of advanced biofuel, 2.76 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel, and 770 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel. The agency is also proposing to add a 250-million-gallon supplemental obligation and has stated its intent to add another 250-million-gallon supplemental obligation in 2023. The supplemental obligations would address the remand of the 2014-2016 annual rule by the D.C. Court of Appeals in Americans for Clean Energy v. EPA. The agency said spreading the obligation over two years would provide the market time to respond to the supplemental obligation.In its comments, the Renewable Fuels Association indicated strong support for the proposed 2022 RVO but said the EPA should increase the proposed 2021 RVO to set the 2021 requirement for conventional renewable fuels at the statutory target of 15 billion gallons\u2014up from the 13.32 billion gallons as currently proposed. The RFA also stressed the need for the EPA to abandon plans to retroactively reduce the existing 2020 RVO.In his comments, Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA, wrote that the organization is \u201cstrongly supportive of the proposed volumes for 2022 for all categories of renewable fuel,\u201d but noted that ethanol producers are \u201cvery troubled by EPA\u2019s questionable proposed use of its \u2018reset\u2019 authority to reopen the 2020 RVO.\u201d According to Cooper, retroactively revising the 2020 RVO \u201c\u2026would set a dangerous precedent and contradict the agency\u2019s long-held position that it does not have the authority to retroactively adjust RFS standards once finalized.\u201dRFA\u2019s comments also express support for EPA\u2019s proposal to restore 500 million gallons of illegally waived RFS requirements from the 2016 RVO, as ordered by the D.C. Circuit Court in the  case, calling EPA\u2019s plan \u201creasonable and fair.\u201dThe American Coalition for Ethanol also warned of the danger posed by EPA\u2019s plan to retroactively reduce the 2020 RVO and called on the EPA to increase the proposed 2021 RVO and finalize the 2022 RVO as proposed.Without corrections for the 2020 and 2021 compliance years, EPA may merely maintain a 2022 statutory volume of 15 billion gallons on paper, Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE. He wrote that if the proposed cuts for 2020 and 2021 are finalized it \u201c\u2026will mean refiners will have amassed a stockpile of carryover RINs with which to meet a 15-billion-gallon implied conventional biofuel volume for 2022 as opposed to blending physical gallons of E15 and higher ethanol blends.\u201dJennings also encouraged the EPA to proactively consider regulatory relief to ensure year-round market access for E15 and urged the agency to replace its badly outdated internal biofuel greenhouse gas (GHG) modeling tool with the latest version of the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s GREET model.In addition, Jennings informed EPA of the first-of-its-kind  ACE and several partners were awarded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture last year to help establish a protocol for ethanol producers and farmers to document the low carbon benefits of certain farming practices and offered praise to USDA Secretary Vilsack for his visionary efforts to establish a new  to scale the deployment of climate-smart farming practices and demonstrate their link to reducing GHG emissions from products such as ethanol.The Coalition for Renewable Natural Gas (RNG Coalition) expressed support for the cellulosic targets included in the proposed 2021 and 2022 RVOs but called on the EPA to enforce the existing 2020 RVOs immediately.\"EPA\u2019s continued support for the expanded production and use of RNG is much appreciated,\u201d wrote Johannes Escudero, founder and CEO of the RNG Coalition. \u201cThe proposed RFS volume requirements providing for a\u00a051 percent increase in the program\u2019s cellulosic biofuel target between 2020 and 2022 is welcomed, and we urge issuing these standards as soon as possible. We also ask that the current 2020 standards be enforced immediately.\"\u201cThe RFS has been a key policy driver and remains critical to the growth of renewable natural gas, including to help decarbonize our medium- and heavy duty transport sector. We are ready to provide increasing volumes of\u00a0domestic, cellulosic biofuels for years to come,\u201d Escudero added.Business aviation groups have also weighed in on the EPA\u2019s proposal, calling on the agency to support the development of SAF through the RFS. General Aviation Manufacturers Association, Helicopter Association International, National Air Transportation Association, and National Business Aviation Association, filed comments on behalf of the Business Aviation Coalition for Sustainable Aviation Fuel, urging the EPA to provide greater opportunities for the development of SAF as it updates the RFS.The coalition said that with the right changes, the RFS can go a long way to helping the U.S. meet the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cSAF Grand Challenge\u201d goal of bringing 3 billion gallons of SAF to the market per year by 2030.The SAF coalition is asking the EPA to expand the list of eligible feedstocks, approve new process technologies and biointermediate opportunities and ensure that RVOs for advanced biofuels are set at levels that will allow grater supplies of those fuels. Specifically, the comments urge the EPA to ensure municipal solid waste (MSW) and woody biomass are included in the definition of biointermediates.\u201cWe hope EPA and this administration recognize the opportunity for SAF moving forward as part of the RFS program,\u201d the SAF coalition wrote. \u201cThe growth in SAF will not happen if EPA does not responsibly improve the regulatory structure of the RFS \u2014 by finalizing biointermediates, by updating the opportunities for both feedstocks and technologies, and by increasing the RVO volumes accordingly.\u201dThe Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and Iowa Corn also addressed EPA\u2019s plan to retroactively reduce the 2020 RVO in joint comments filed with the agency. The groups\u2019 comments highlight EPA\u2019s reasoning that the 2020 RVOs projected for the first time that the agency would grant a large number of SREs for the compliance year. \u201cGiven the potential impacts on EPA\u2019s SRE policy and the increased likelihood that EPA will not be granting a large number of SREs due to the 10th Circuit Court decisions in RFA and HollyFrontier, the agency argues that reconsideration is warranted given that a change in EPA\u2019s SRE policy could lead to a drawdown of carryover RINs. We disagree wholeheartedly with this line of reasoning,\u201d wrote the IRFA and Iowa Corn. \u201cFirst, even if the EPA feels this approach would be \u2018best\u2019 or \u2018fair,\u2019 if the EPA does not possess the authority to do so, then that\u2019s the end of the discussion.\u201cHowever, if after years of insisting that it does not have the authority to reopen previously finalized RFS rules, EPA now finds the authority to do so because the impact of SREs was improperly accounted for in 2020, why should we stop with reopening only the 2020 rule? To be fair, why don\u2019t we reopen the 2012-2019 finalized RVO rules as well, since NONE of those final rules properly accounted for the impact of SREs either? Why would EPA choose to reopen and retroactively reduce the one and only rule in which improper accounting of SREs benefited biofuel demand, while leaving the 2012-2019 rules in place where improper accounting of SREs destroyed over 4 billion gallons of biofuel demand? If the authority exists to go back in time to reopen a final rule, the authority must also clearly exist to reopen a closed compliance period for annual RVOs such as those in 2012-2019,\u201d IRFA and Iowa Corn continued.Growth Energy urged the EPA to quickly propose the 2020 RVO and fix the flaws in the proposed RVOs for 2020 and 2021. \u201cThe Renewable Fuel Standard was designed by Congress to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our transportation sector, improve U.S. energy security, and support American economic growth,\u201d said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. \u201cIf the Biden Administration enforces the RFS as previously promised, the RFS can be an even more powerful weapon in the fight against climate change, improving air quality, and addressing environmental justice concerns. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cEPA\u2019s proposal includes a number of forward-looking actions that underscore the critical role biofuels play in decarbonizing the transportation sector,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are encouraged that EPA\u2019s proposal for 2022 RVOs would place the RFS program back on track with 15 billion gallons implied conventional ethanol requirements that account for any estimated future small refinery exemptions. We urge the EPA to finalize the 2022 proposal immediately to get these RVOs in place for this compliance year and provide biofuel producers with much needed market certainty.\u201cHowever, EPA\u2019s proposal includes some serious flaws that need to be addressed in the final rule,\u201d Skor continued. \u201cIt contains unlawful and unnecessary retroactive cuts to the 2020 RVO and includes inexcusably late volumes for 2021 that simply reflect actual production volumes rather than spur refiners to meet Congress\u2019s RFS goals. Such moves, if finalized, would create further uncertainty in the renewable fuel marketplace and undervalue biofuels as a low-carbon, homegrown fuel and its role in our nation\u2019s battle with climate change.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0In its comments, Clean Fuels Alliance America expressed concern with EPA\u2019s triggering \u201creset\u201d authority and proposals for regulating biointermediates.Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels\u2019 vice president of federal affairs, writes in the comments on the annual volumes, \u201cWe ask EPA to provide certainty to the biodiesel and renewable diesel industry, do not unlawfully use the reset authority to retroactively adjust the 2020 volumes, and be cautious of unintended consequences associated with the biointermediates provisions.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0"

The EIA collected data from 80 operating manufacturers of densified biomass fuel to complete the report. The report does not include data on facilities with annual production capacities of less than 10,000 tons. Those smaller facilities report data annually rather than monthly.The 80 manufacturers surveyed for September had a total combined production capacity of 12.98 million tons per year and collectively had the equivalent of 2,322 full-time employees.Respondents purchased 1.46 million tons of raw biomass feedstock in September, produced 750,000 tons of densified biomass fuel and sold 930,000 tons of densified biomass fuel. Production included 150,916 tons of heating pellets and 603,432 tons of utility pellets.Domestic sales of densified biomass fuel in September reached 220,454 tons at an average price of $187.15 per ton. Exports in September reached 715,179 tons at an average price of $171.84 per ton.Inventories of premium/standard pellets fell to 254,422 tons in September, down from 269,886 tons in August. Inventories of utility pellets fell to 324,412 tons in September, down from 383,585 tons in August.Data gathered by the EIA shows that total U.S. densified biomass fuel capacity reached 13 million tons in September, with all of that capacity listed as currently operating or temporarily not in operation. Capacity included 1.98 million tons in the East, 10.2 million tons in the South, and 838,000 tons in the West.\u00a0"

    "text": "Perhaps worse than reinventing the wheel is being\u00a0to reinvent the wheel. Unfortunately, that has been a reality for many scientists working to develop catalysts used to upgrade waste or biomass resources into climate-friendly biofuels.Gathering and analyzing existing catalyst data usually means digging through stacks of journal articles, a slow and painstaking process requiring close scrutiny. It\u2019s no wonder that many scientists find it faster to start from scratch and simply measure the same data themselves. In practice, this duplication of efforts can translate into years\u2019 worth of redundant work\u2014and even millions of dollars.This is no recipe for rapidly growing the biofuel industry, a key part of ambitious targets to decarbonize aviation with net-zero and carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel.It\u2019s a practical problem that merits a practical solution: the Catalyst Property Database (CPD).First released in September 2020 with the support of the U.S. Department of Energy Bioenergy Technologies Office, the\u00a0\u00a0developed by a team at NREL led by Kurt Van Allsburg and Carrie Farberow.The tool adds to a robust portfolio of capabilities offered by the\u00a0\u00a0(ChemCatBio). ChemCatBio works to decarbonize the economy by accelerating the development of catalytic technologies that convert biomass and waste resources into renewable fuels and chemicals.The CPD advances that mission by making it faster and cheaper to identify the right catalyst formula for specific biofuel production processes. Officially open to external uploads in September 2021, the CPD stands to accelerate biofuels research even more.Here are three reasons why:Around the world, countless scientists are collaborating on needed technologies for reducing carbon emissions across the global economy. In biofuels research, that joint effort has yielded promising breakthroughs in the design of catalysts\u2014materials, often based on transition metals, that are used to speed up the conversion of biomass into biofuels.But such dramatic progress has also led to dizzying numbers of research articles. With thousands of high-quality papers published every year, each containing numerous pieces of useful data, it can be challenging to efficiently find and build on those data and insights.With the CPD, valuable data is never more than a quick search away\u2014no poring over papers required. The literature mining has already been done by the CPD, and the journal article source is just one click away when needed.The tool\u2019s clean, modern interface enables researchers to quickly filter and define research results to match their own requirements. They can search detailed metadata on catalysts directly rather than combing through journal articles. They can review relevant details, such as catalyst composition and adsorbate surface coverage, on a growing number of catalysts.Now open to the public, data uploads, as well as the breadth and detail of that data, stand to grow substantially.Simply finding a journal article with catalyst data is not enough. Scientists must also make sure its data and results are compatible with their own study, finding answers to questions such as:\u2022Were      experiments performed under similar conditions (temperature, pressure,      solvent)?\u2022Was      the same software with comparable methods used for computational results?\u2022Do      units and definitions match up?Without the CPD, those questions aren\u2019t easy to answer, making it time-consuming to use previously published data as a benchmark. The result? More time spent filtering existing data and less time studying new catalysts.The CPD standardizes catalyst data so it\u2019s accessible to any study and to any researcher. It does this through rules on uploading data, as well as standard naming practices that make search results predictable and reliable. In this way, users have more confidence in data that has already been collected. They can easily share, cite, and build upon the work of other catalyst researchers.The United States has ample supplies of renewable resources that can be upgraded into sustainable biofuels. These resources have diverse properties and chemistries. Some may have high levels of oxygen and water. Others could contain impurities, have diverse chemical functionalities, or exhibit other unique attributes.It\u2019s not surprising, then: researchers face a slow, difficult process to design catalysts that can accommodate these diverse traits.By using the CPD\u2019s growing set of catalyst data, researchers are better equipped to uncover relationships between catalyst properties and targeted catalytic reactions to:As more types of experimental and computational data are added to the CPD, it is likely that new types of relationships will be discovered. For example, researchers can use easy-to-measure results (like a chemical or physical property of a catalyst) to predict hard-to-measure reactor performance (such as catalyst activity with real biomass feeds).Scientific breakthroughs are cultivated in strong research communities where data and insights can be readily shared, scrutinized, and cited.As a virtual library designed to make catalyst data easier to find and utilize, the CPD is fertile ground for driving similar innovations in catalysis. This helps scientists focus on what\u2019s most important: developing the next generation of catalytic technologies needed to rapidly decarbonize the global economy.With upcoming expansions and future data types, NREL\u2019s team aims to deepen the CPD\u2019s practical value to the research community. These include:\u2022User      interface and search improvements\u2022More      data from the literature\u2022A      feature to convert adsorption energies between different gas-phase      references\u2022A      pilot of machine learning technologies to rapidly screen data\u2022A      dataset on reducing catalyst deactivation from contaminants and carbon      buildup.Together, these efforts support ChemCatBio\u2019s long-term vision for a powerful Catalyst Design Engine. Built on the foundation of the CPD and\u00a0, this design engine will consider all available cost and performance data to recommend new catalysts for a researcher\u2019s biofuel application.That is another step toward guiding catalyst discovery, accelerating the pace of biofuels research to build a flourishing bioeconomy, faster.\u00a0\u00a0"

The USDA said the payments to biofuel producers will support the maintenance and viability of a significant market for agricultural producers of products, such as corn, soybeans or biomass, that supply biofuel production.Under the original program rules, the program would make payments to eligible producers based upon the volume of market loss the biofuel producer experienced in calendar year 2020, with a producer\u2019s volume of market loss will be calculated by comparing the amount of fuel they produced in calendar year 2020 to the amount of fuel produced in 2019. Eligible gallons of biofuel produced by the eligible producer in 2020 to meet required contractual commitments resulting in a gross profit loss will be deducted from 2020 production by the agency\u2019s calculation of program payments, the USDA said in the Dec. 13 notice.\u00a0The USDA is now amending those requirements. According to the agency\u2019s new notice, the agency is amending sections A, D and E of the original notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) to specify that eligible biofuel produced by eligible producers in 2020 to meet required contractual commitments, marketing obligations, or fulfill or maintain essential markets, resulting in a gross profit loss will be deducted\u00a0from 2020 production by the agency\u2019s calculation of program payments. Gross profit loss related to required production can be based on either the entire 2020 year, or a period in 2020 specified by the applicant, according to the agency.Payments made under the Biofuel Producer Program will be based on a fixed amount per gallon for all eligible producers.

    "text": "In partnership with Enbridge Gas, the Canadian Urban Transit Research & Innovation Consortium (CUTRIC) is proud to launch three holistic studies comparing buses powered with renewable natural gas (RNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), and diesel fuel.Conducted separately for Calgary Transit, Orange County Transportation Authority, and TransLink, these four-month projects analyze factors ranging from fuel usage and vehicle maintenance to the total cost of ownership and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on differing propulsion fuels in transit buses. Each project delivers a comprehensive review of existing CNG and RNG applications across Canadian and U.S. transit fleets, and determines total emissions based on transit fleet data from selected samples and average values.\u201cWith thousands of RNG-fuelled buses already operating in transit fleets across the United States, CUTRIC\u2019s comparative analysis will determine whether RNG can quickly enable carbon-neutral mobility in Calgary, Orange County and across B.C., without sacrificing performance, reliability or range,\u201d said CUTRIC President and CEO Josipa Petrunic. \u201cThe drive to eliminate emissions is rightly focused on the integration of new technologies, such as battery electric buses (BEBs) and hydrogen fuel-cell electric buses (FCEBs). But RNG is often overlooked as another easily accessible, available and simple net zero emissions alternative fuel for Canadian transit agencies today. Our study will show the extent to which RNG can support the drive-to-zero emissions today.\u201dRNG can play a vital role in reducing transit emissions by drastically reducing the cost and complexity of transitioning to zero emission buses (ZEBs). It is interchangeable with the conventional natural gas used in existing and conventional CNG buses. It can be transported through existing pipeline systems to transit agency facilities using regular gas nomination and scheduling processes.\u201cHeavy transportation is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The good news is we can decarbonize heavy transport effectively today through CNG, a market-ready practical solution which offers significant GHG and cost advantages as compared to diesel, and incorporating RNG generated from organic waste, you can get to zero emissions,\u201d said Malini Giridhar, vice president of business development and regulatory, Enbridge Gas.A new CNG bus fueled by RNG costs about the same as a regular diesel bus, as does its fueling system, making it a cost-effective alternative for transit agencies struggling with the costs and complexities of decarbonization.\u201cRNG is a key element of TransLink\u2019s Low Carbon Fleet Strategy. For us, RNG is a win-win: it is a cost-effective alternative to diesel and significantly reduces our fleet CO2 emissions. Its local production from agricultural and municipal waste also supports a circular, low carbon economy,\u201d said Ralf Nielsen, director \u2013 enterprise sustainability, TransLink.With roughly 825 CNG buses on Canadian roads today, and with Canada\u2019s 10 operating RNG production facilities soon to be joined by another 230 that are in development, or under construction in Ontario alone, the technology is able to help displace diesel, one of the most carbon-intensive and costly fuels in the marketplace. This has already happened across the United States, where RNG-fuelled buses are operating in transit fleets of all sizes, including Los Angeles Metro and New York City Transit.\u201cAs Canadians, transit agencies and governments rally to fight climate change and recover from the pandemic. It\u2019s time for an all-hands-on-deck approach to reducing emissions,\u201d Petrunic said. \u201cThis means using all the tools in our toolkit to combat pollution. RNG is one of those tools.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "Today, LanzaJet, a sustainable fuels technology company and renewable fuels producer, announced it has secured financing for its Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Soperton, Georgia, through the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund. The Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund has made a $50 million investment to support the construction of LanzaJet\u2019s (and the world\u2019s) first alcohol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production plant. The innovative structure of Microsoft\u2019s financing will enable LanzaJet to bring lower-cost sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel to the global market.LanzaJet is dedicated to accelerating the energy transition in sectors where decarbonization is hard, such as aviation. LanzaJet produces SAF and renewable diesel from low-carbon, sustainable ethanol sources. This investment also creates the opportunity for LanzaJet and the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund to work together in enabling LanzaJet, through the Freedom Pines Fuels plant, to catalyze the market for 2\u00a0generation, waste-based ethanol feedstock, demonstrating clear demand signals for ethanol that can achieve greater carbon reductions.The construction of Freedom Pines Fuels is progressing as planned, even with supply chain, manufacturing, and labor shortages impacting the global economy. Fabrication of the plant is well underway; some modules are already completed and final site engineering is nearing completion. The LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels plant is expected to achieve mechanical completion this year and begin producing 10 million gallons of SAF and renewable diesel per year from sustainable ethanol, including from waste-based feedstocks, in 2023.The investment was made as part of Microsoft\u2019s efforts to achieve its 2030 goal of becoming carbon negative and advancing a net-zero economy. It also allows Microsoft to access sustainable, renewable diesel for its data centers to enable Microsoft to further achieve its net-zero goals.Demand for sustainable fuels is increasing, and governments like those in the United States and the United Kingdom are leading the transition by encouraging sustainable fuel production. The Biden administration set a goal for achieving net-zero aviation emissions by 2050, with the E.U. wanting to increase the amount of SAF blended to 63% by 2050. In September of 2021, the White House announced a target of 3 billion gallons of SAF produced per year by 2030. As part of that announcement, LanzaJet shared it would strive to achieve 1B gallons of SAF production in the US by 2030, significantly supporting US ambitions.Private sector investment and government support are crucial to enabling the development and scale-up of new technologies to curb carbon emissions as the world tackles climate change. The collaboration between LanzaJet and the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund demonstrates that such an innovative investment approach breaks down barriers by deploying new technologies, improves our nation\u2019s infrastructure, and creates new economic opportunities in rural communities. The development of LanzaJet\u2019s Freedom Pines Fuels plant is also supported by funding from the U.S. Department of Energy Bioenergy Technologies Office.LanzaJet continues to work with its founding investors to scale up the production of sustainable fuels to meet global demand and to enable the energy transition underway. Microsoft\u2019s financial support of LanzaJet joins other LanzaJet funders including LanzaTech, Inc., Suncor Energy Inc., Mitsui & Co., Ltd., British Airways, Shell, and All Nippon Airways \u2013 all who are working together to catalyze and build a new global market for sustainable fuels.Jimmy Samartzis, LanzaJet CEO, said, \u201cWe know that creating the change which our world desperately needs requires perseverance, innovation, and like-minded partnerships. We are thrilled to bring on Microsoft and its Climate Innovation Fund to help us build our first-of-its-kind sustainable fuels plant in Georgia. The partnership with Microsoft is more than just financing \u2013 it advances our work towards net zero fuels, it enables lower-cost sustainable fuels into the market, and it supports the urgency to have real, proven technologies scale-up and deploy.\u201d\u201cWe set a bold ambition to support the White House with a goal of 1 billion gallons of sustainable fuels by 2030. With Microsoft\u2019s support, this first plant significantly expands the production of sustainable fuels in the US, establishes Georgia as a leader in clean tech, and is the foundation for us as the first alcohol-to-jet sustainable fuels producer, and as a blueprint for the commercial plants we\u2019re developing globally.\u201dBrandon Middaugh of Microsoft\u2019s Climate Innovation Fund said, \u201cWith this investment, we support LanzaJet in creating new pathways to help companies across industries achieve net-zero carbon through the use of sustainable fuels. Decarbonizing hard to abate industries and technologies will be essential to achieving our carbon reduction goals by 2030. We look forward to working with LanzaJet to accelerate the global development and deployment of high-quality, sustainable fuels technologies.\u201dGeorgia Gov. Brian P. Kemp said, \u201cLanzaJet is adding to Georgia\u2019s growing sustainability ecosystem with the development of their aviation fuel and renewable diesel products,\u201d said Georgia Governor Brian P. Kemp. \u201cWe congratulate LanzaJet, Microsoft, Soperton, and Treutlen County on this innovative opportunity. We\u2019re proud that they\u2019re growing in Georgia\u2019s pro-business environment, and we look forward to working with them to support their production goals in the future.\u201dSen. Jon Ossoff (Georgia), said, \u201cThis is good news for Georgia. My vision remains that Georgia should lead the nation in clean energy and renewable energy technology \u2014 including sustainable aviation fuels. I brought the Secretary of Energy to visit the LanzaJet site last year, and I will continue working to promote clean energy technology and create Georgia jobs.\u201dRep. Rick Allen (GA-12), said, \u201cThis is great news for Georgia\u2019s 12th District as it will enable continued investment and workforce development in Soperton. I applaud LanzaJet on today\u2019s announcement, which is the result of free markets and innovation at work.\u201dState Sen. Blake Tillery (Vidalia-19), said, \u201cWe are continually working on jobs and investment in rural Georgia and are excited about what this announcement today means for Treutlen County and the surrounding areas.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0"

Oftentimes, small communities don\u2019t have the platform or the credibility to promote themselves as great areas for future biobased development. BDO Zone designations change that, and raise the flag over these communities as some of the best areas in the country to build the next biobased plant.\u201dAmerican biomass provides an economic development engine with the potential to create 160,000 jobs and nearly $15 billion of economic benefit. The BDO Zone Initiative can help the U.S. realize this potential by supporting new market development for American bioenergy, advanced biofuels, biobased heat and power, bio-materials, and clean hydrogen.

Those facilities operated at an estimated 50 percent of capacity, producing 460 million liters of fuel. Canada currently has no operational renewable diesel production capacity, but 81 million liters of capacity is expected to come online this year, growing to as much as 3.27 billion liters over the next four years.Canada imported 497 million liters of biodiesel in 2021, up from 384 million liters in 2020. Renewable diesel imports reached 480 million liters last year, down from 500 million liters in 2021. Canada also exported 435 million liters of biodiesel last year, down from 451 million liters in 2020.The blend rate for biodiesel and renewable diesel was approximately 2.8 percent last year, up from 2.7 percent in 2020.Canada\u2019s Clean Fuel Standard is expected to boost biofuel use in the coming years. The program aims to achieve 30 million tons of annual reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030, according to the report.A draft regulation was published in December 2020, outlining a nationwide framework for adopting a carbon intensity (CI) approach for renewable fuels. The final regulation is expected to be published this spring.A full copy of the report can be downloaded from the USDA FAS GAIN .\u00a0"

    "text": "Strategic Biofuels and the Port of Columbia in Caldwell Parish, Louisiana, on Jan. 19 announced the port has received a $15 million infrastructure and improvement grant that will benefit Strategic Biofuels\u2019 proposed Louisiana Green Fuels project.The proposed 33.7 MMgy biorefinery, located at the Port of Colombia, will convert wood waste into biobased fuels. I indicates the facility will target production of both renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). At that time, the state said Strategic Biofuels was completing feasibility and financing phases for the project and was expected to make a final investment decision by late 2022.The proposed project is also expected to feature a carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) component to enable the production of carbon-negative fuel. A , according to Strategic Biofuels.The $15 million infrastructure improvement grant was awarded through the Louisiana Port Construction and Development Priority Program, which is administrated by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development. The funds will support a road upgrade, the development of a 37-car rail spur to allow access to the Union Pacific mainline that borders the plant site, and construction of a rail overpass.\u201cThe infrastructure improvement grant represents a major advancement for the Port of Columbia and Caldwell Parish,\u201d said Greg Richardson, port director. \u201cIt allows the Port to improve the services it can offer and ultimately improve revenues. Because of the grant\u2019s potential impact, the Port engaged Gary LaGrange,longtime Director of the Port of New Orleans, to help us navigate the grant application process. During Gary\u2019s 15-year tenure with the Port of New Orleans, he was responsible for more than $500 million in infrastructure improvements before he retired in 2016. Our success in securing the grant confirmed the Port Commissioners\u2019 wisdom in engaging him.\u201d\u201cWe greatly appreciate the efforts the Port has made to secure funding for infrastructure improvements,\u201d said Bob Meredith, chief operating officer of Strategic Biofuels. \u201cThe early upgrading of Riverton Camp Road coming this summer provides strong support for LGF\u2019s aggressive construction schedule. It allows us to begin actual plant construction as soon as the full project funding is secured, and we expect that to be in early 2023. The Port has also been a key contributor in our efforts with DOTD and Union Pacific Railroad. The strong support we\u2019ve continued to receive from Caldwell Parish confirms the wisdom of locating the plant here.\u201d\u00a0"

Collectively, those notices describe plans for the production of nearly 800 MMgy of advanced biofuels.NCD has formed a dedicated team to collaborate on the review of the PMNs for biobased or waste-derived feedstocks used to make transportation fuel substitutes with the goal to use the best available science while creating a consistent and efficient review process. According to the EPA, NCD has developed a standardized process to review biofuel PMNs. Under that process, the same dedicated team will conduct reviews for all biofuel PMNs. NDC will also generate one report for biofuel PMNs that combines the six different risk assessments typically conducted for PMNs. For risk management actions, NDC will apply appropriate mitigation measures to address any potential for unreasonable risk identified in an efficient and consistent manner with TSCA consent orders and significant new use rules (SNURs).OCSPP will hold a for interested stakeholders in the biofuel sector. A kick-ff meeting, scheduled for Feb. 9, will provide an overview of the initiative and answer stakeholder questions. A session on Feb. 23 will focus on TSCA requirements and the PMN process, while a March 9 webinar will focus on TSCA inventory, nomenclature and Bona Fide process, a March 23 event will focus on new chemical risk assessments and applications of the tools and models, and an April 6 webinar will focus on new chemicals risk management actions, including TSCA section 5 orders and significant new use rules (SNURs).

    "text": "The 2022 Iowa Renewable Fuels Summit, held Jan. 25, highlighted significant opportunities for growth driven by demand for advanced biofuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but also addressed policy and economic concerns impacting biofuel producers.Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, provided an overview of political and regulatory issues impacting the biofuels sector, stressing that Iowa\u2019s biofuel industry is \u201cfed up but fired up.\u201dThe industry entered 2021 with renewed optimism, he said. \u201cVaccines were rolling out and it felt like we were turning the corner on COVID.\u201d The Biden administration\u2019s stated commitment to biofuels and the U.S. EPA\u2019s announcement that it would rein in small refinery exemptions (SREs) added to the hopeful outlook. That optimism, however, began to fade as the year went on, Shaw said. The Delta and Omicron waves of COVID put economic recovery in question and supply chain issues are driving high inflation rates. \u201cThe RFS exemption denials did not come. The DC Circuit Court threw out year-round E15,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThe Biden Build Back Better bill rolled out with billions for electric vehicles (EVs) and nothing initially for renewables.\u201dThe EPA finally released its proposed Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations (RVOs) for 2021 and 2022 in late 2021. While the proposed RVO for 2022 is strong, Shaw called the proposed 2021 RVO disappointing and said the agency\u2019s decision to reopen, and likely reduce, the 2020 RVO is dismaying. \u201cAnd throughout the year from Washington, D.C., came an incessant drumbeat that electric vehicles were the only solution for our transportation future,\u201d he said, thanking the Iowa delegation for standing united across party lines in support of biofuels.Shaw stressed that biofuels must play a part in decarbonizing transportation, noting that the RFS is the only federal law on the books today designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation fuels.\u201cI can clearly say the state of the Iowa biofuels industry in 2022 is fed up, but fired up,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cWe are fed up at seemingly being ignored or marginalized, but we are fired up to succeed in spite of it.\u201dShaw addressed the potential that carbon capture offers to biofuel and ag prodcuers. \u201cWhen corn and soybean plants grow, they suck CO2 out of the atmosphere,\u201d he said. \u201cWith improved efficiencies at the farm and biofuel plant level, I firmly believe that one day biofuels can and will be net carbon negative. Achieving that goal will require carbon sequestration and carbon pipelines. These projects are essential to the long-term viability of biofuels. As a guy still active in my family\u2019s farming operation, I know how emotional some of these issues can be. So, I pledge to work with farmers and policymakers to ensure we have a fair and equitable path forward.\u201dRegarding the need for year-round E15, Shaw applauded Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for leading a Midwest effort to find a regional solution in the absence of federal action. \u201cThe Clean Air Act allows governors to take action to ensure the regulatory treatment for E10 and E15 is the same,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cBy exercising this authority, governors can restore year-round E15 sales for retailers and motorists. IRFA is proud to be working with Gov. Reynolds and groups in other states to push for a Midwest E15 solution.\u201dSeveral speakers at the event discussed the significant opportunity offered by rapidly expanding demand for drop-in biofuels, such as renewable diesel and SAF.Donnell Rehagen, CEO of Clean Fuels Alliance America, delivered a keynote address that discussed the substantial growth potential offered by SAF and renewable diesel. While federal policy in support of biofuels is incredibly important, Rehagen stressed that state-level policies also help to drive growth in demand for biofuels.State policies currently create markets for approximately 1.9 billion gallons of biodiesel and renewable diesel, he said. By 2030, Rehagen said state markets could drive that demand to 5.3 billion gallons, with California leading that demand at more than 3 billion gallons. Corporate policy is also expected to have a huge impact on demand for biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF moving forward, Rehagen said, as companies like Amazon and Microsoft work to reduce supply chain emissions.Steve Csonka, executive director of the Commercial Aviation Alterative Fuels Initiative, spoke about the potential of SAF during a roundtable on emerging markets. He said in the U.S. alone, the aviation industry offers a 26-billion-gallon market opportunity. Worldwide, the market for aviation fuel is nearly 100 billion gallons\u2014and that market will continue to grow. Jet fuel demand is expected to expand by 3-5 percent annually for the foreseeable future, he said, driven largely by developing economies. Increased fossil fuel consumption also means increasing GHG emissions.\u201cWe don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that allows us to curtail that other than the use of SAF,\u201d Csonka said, noting SAF is the only reasonable approach to reducing GHG emissions from the aviation sector.SAF can achieve GHG reductions of 65 percent and higher, with some technologies showing the ability to be carbon-negative. Ethanol can be used as a feedstock for SAF production, Csonka said, but stressed that ethanol used as a feedstock for SAF will need to have a low carbon index to ensure finished fuel has a carbon reduction of at least 50-60 percent.Csonka also discussed the need for SAF to be both affordable and sustainable in order for the aviation sector to truely embrace the use renewable fuels. The global aviation industry has set a goal to be net zero by 2050, with focus on the use of SAF, he said \u201cWe expect 65 percent of our reduction worldwide to come from the use of SAF,\u201d Csonka added, noting that there are interim commitments for 10 percent SAF use by 2030.The Iowa Renewable Fuels Summit also featured roundtable discussions focused reducing the carbon footprint of biofuels, renewable fuels policy and the economic outlook.The IRFA plans to post full replays of the summit presentations to its  soon.\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "Enviva Inc. on Jan. 19 announced accelerated plans to double its wood pellet production capacity and said it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a U.S.-based customer that plans to convert woody biomass supplied by Enviva into low-carbon transportation fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).Enviva did not disclose the name of the company that plans to convert its woody biomass into transportation fuels but did note that the biofuel producer is Enviva\u2019s first U.S.-based customer. The customer plans to convert Enviva\u2019s wood biomass into a drop-in replacement for crude oil used to produce aviation fuel via its refining process. Under the MOU, the two companies will co-develop a supply chain strategy for advanced low-carbon transportation fuels with a focus on the customer\u2019s operations in the U.S. Southeast and potentially California.Enviva said its current operations and numerous potential development sites in the Southeast position it to co-develop alongside the SAF refining capacity the customer intends to construct in the region. Enviva is also evaluating plans to build one or more facilities in California with the intent of utilizing low-grade wood fiber from high-hazard zones in the state.The newly announced MOU represents Enviva\u2019s second agreement related to SAF. In November, Enviva announced the singing of a 10-year take-or-pay off-take contract with an industrial customer in Europe for 60,000 metric tons per year of wood pellets to be used as feedstock for the production of SAF and other biofuels. Deliveries under the initial tranche of that contract are scheduled to begin in 2023, with volumes potentially increasing to approximately 1.2 million metric tons per year by 2027.\u201cWe are extremely excited about the growth in Enviva\u2019s business and our first MOU with a U.S. customer,\u201d said John Keppler, chairman and CEO at Enviva. \u201cEfforts around the world to decarbonize in order to meet net zero by 2050 continue to accelerate, giving companies like ours the tremendous opportunity to grow even more rapidly and expand the global supply chain as necessary to continue to facilitate the energy transition and mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions profile of hard-to-abate industries such as steel, cement, lime, and biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuels. We are very proud to now be in a position to not only export the sustainable, renewable energy and low-carbon feedstock we produce in the Southeastern United States, but to combat both climate change and devastating wildfire risks by expanding the long-term contracted use of our products and growing our customer and production footprint right here at home in the broader U.S.\u201dEnviva also announced plans to double its production capacity over the next five years, from its current capacity 6.2 million metric tons per year to approximately 13 million metric tons per year. The company plans to continue utilizing its \u201cbuild and copy\u201d approach to plant design while increasing the nameplate production capacity of its new plans to approximately 1.1 million metric tons per year, up approximately 45 percent when compared to its previous standard of 750,000 metric tons per year. To aid in the rapid expansion, Enviva said it broadening and deepening its development capabilities and leveraging relationships with key equipment suppliers and construction partners to enable it to build and commission two plants per year, up from its historical rate of one plant per year.The new production capacity is expected to include a third wood pellet plant in its Pascagoula cluster. The first two facilities in that cluster\u2014the Lucedale, Mississippi, and Epes, Alabama, plants\u2014are already under development. The Lucedale facility is expected to ramp up production this year to 750,000 metric tons per year, expanding capacity to approximately 1 million metric tons per year in 2023. Construction on the Epes plant is expected to begin during the first half of 2022.In addition to the Pascagoula cluster, Enviva said it is also planning to develop facilities in the Savannah and mid-Atlantic regions. In total, the company plans to put six plants into service over the next five years.A full copy of the Enviva\u2019s announcement is available on the company\u2019s .\u00a0"

    "text": "Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack discussed the important role biofuels and biobased manufacturing play in the rural economy and highlighted the agency\u2019s efforts to support those industries during a Jan. 20 hearing held by the House Agriculture Committee.In his opening statement, Vilsack focused on the phrase \u201can extraction economy\" and the need to create a circular economy where wealth is created and stays in rural areas. He explained that many of the raw resources produced by the ag economy are currently transported long distances, and value-added at some other location. As a result, opportunities and jobs are created in areas other than rural America. \u201cI think its going to be important to us as we look forward to try to develop what is called a circular economy, in which the wealth is created and stays in rural areas,\" he said.\u00a0Vilsack offered several examples of a circular economy, including biobased manufacturing. \u201cBiofuels is one example, but there are a multitude of ways in which we can convert agricultural waste products into a wide variety of things beyond renewable energy and fuel, to include chemicals, materials, fabrics, fibers\u2014again creating opportunities for farmers and additional income sources as well as rural jobs.\u201dHe also stressed that climate change creates an opportunity for the ag sector. \u201cAs we look at ways in which rural lands can be used to sequester carbon\u2014as we embrace climate smart agricultural practices\u2014it opens up a whole new vista of opportunity for farmers to essentially be paid for the carbon sequestration that they are currently doing and will do in the future,\u201d Vilsack said.Vilsack also field several questions related to biofuels, the Renewable Fuel Standard, E15 and electric vehicles during the hearing.Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., referenced recent media reports that the Biden administration is considering lowering its proposed 2022 renewable volume obligation (RVO) and asked Vilsack to comment on those rumors.In response, Vilsack stressed that the proposed RVO for 2022 is the highest in the history of the RFS program. He also discussed the $700 million in COVID-19 relief for biofuels and the $100 million in biofuel infrastructure funds that the USDA has announced it will distribute this year and highlighted the importance of the U.S. EPA\u2019s proposal to deny more than 65 small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions.Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., also questioned Vilsack on the importance of biofuels and the Biden administration\u2019s support for the industry.Vilsack outlined four primary benefits of the biofuels industry. He said the industry supports stability in farm income, increases jobs in rural areas, provides consumers with choice at the pump, and benefits the environment. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important for the industry to have stability,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, stability comes not just from setting a [strong RVO], but from making sure that number is real.\u201d He discussed the Trump administration\u2019s overuse of SRE waivers, noting that RVOs finalized by Trump\u2019s EPA were not real, rather they were greatly dissipated by the granting of SREs. The current administration plans to deny more than 65 pending SRE petitions, which will result in a \u201creal\u201d RVO. \u201cI think the stability is going to be very helpful to this industry,\u201d he said. \u00a0Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., said her constituents are concerned about the Biden administration\u2019s focus on electric vehicles and questioned if the administration has shown sufficient support for biofuels.In response, Vilsack reiterated the importance of the $700 million in pandemic relief and $100 million in infrastructure support that the USDA is offering to the biofuels industry, along with the impact of the EPA\u2019s decision to reign in the SRE program. He also stressed that the Biden administration has also set an ambitious goal for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). \u201cI think it\u2019s very unfair to suggest that this administration has not been supportive of the biofuel industry,\u201d he said.Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., also questioned Vilsack regarding the focus on electric vehicles. \u201cThere is a lot of conversation about electric cars,\u201d Vilsack said, but stressed that cars with internal combustion engines will continue to remain on the road for the foreseeable future and will require the use of biofuels. Liquid biofuels will also continue to be necessary for aviation and marine transport. \u201cWe won\u2019t see the elimination of [the biofuels industry]\u2014we\u2019ll see an expansion of it,\u201d Vilsack said. \u201cI\u2019m excited about this industry and think the future is bright.\u201dRep. Michelle Fischbach, R-Minn., expressed concern that the fact that biofuels reduce emissions is getting lost in the conversion on climate change, and asked about the agency\u2019s support for biofuels. \u201cI am confidence that I am one of the most ardent proponents of biofuels anywhere in this country and have been for years\u2014decades,\u201d Vilsack said in response, assuring the committee that biobased fuels remain a priority for the current administration.Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said Vilsack has long championed efforts to expand biomanufacturing and asked about the impact recently allocated funding will have that sector.Vilsack explained that a Congress allocated a relatively small amount of funds the agency in a recent infrastructure bill to look at the issue of biobased manufacturing. That funding, he said, could have a profound impact on rural America. Biobased manufacturing provides a market for a variety of agricultural waste products, Vilsack said. Those materials can be used to produce not only fuels, but also chemicals, materials, fabrics, fibers and renewable energy\u2014all of which creates a circular economy, creates new income sources for farmers, and helps avoid some of the environmental challenges associated with some ag industries. He potential, he said, is unlimited and \u201crural America is ripe for this opportunity.\u201dA full replay of the hearing is available on the House Agriculture Committee .\u00a0\u00a0"

Inc. and Brightmark Fund Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of the global waste solutions provider Brightmark LLC \u2013 today announced plans to construct an anaerobic digestion project at Vlot Calf Ranch in Chowchilla, California.The Vlot anaerobic digestion project is anticipated to capture, clean, and convert methane from manure that would otherwise escape to the atmosphere on the Vlot Calf Ranch and dairy farm into renewable natural gas (RNG). When used in the transportation sector, renewable natural gas from dairy operations has a negative carbon intensity on a lifecycle basis under California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard. The Vlot Project is Brightmark RNG Holdings LLC\u2019s first renewable natural gas project in the state of California.\"The Vlot Project represents a major milestone for Brightmark and its RNG production efforts,\" said Bob Powell, founder and CEO of Brightmark. \"Being able to partner with Chevron and the Vlot Calf Ranch on our largest RNG project to date and first project in our home state of California represents a particular point of pride for our company and efforts.\u201d\u201cAs a California company, Chevron has provided the state\u2019s residents with affordable, reliable energy for more than 140 years,\u201d said Andy Walz, president of Americas Fuels & Lubricants for Chevron. \u201cDeveloping and delivering renewable natural gas with Brightmark and the Vlot Calf Ranch, once completed, demonstrates our commitment to working across critical sectors of the state\u2019s economy to increase the supply of fuels with a lower lifecycle carbon intensity.\u201d\"Sustainability considerations and agriculture go hand-in-hand; one cannot exist without the other,\" said Case Vlot of Vlot Calf Ranch. \"As farmers and livestock owners, we take pride in caring for our land and environment because we know that when we do that, it will in turn, take care of us and our animals. It is what farmers, ranchers and dairy farmers do. Innovation in agriculture is constant and ever-changing. This digester is another step in providing environmental benefits to our farm and surroundings. In this case, it's utilizing the manure from our cattle in an anaerobic digester that will help generate those benefits to continue our legacy in sustainability. We are looking forward to seeing this project completed.\"The project is expected to be completed in 2023. Other renewable products generated by the project include recycled water back to the farm, biofertilizer and digested dairy fiber, which can be used as cow bedding or as a peat moss substitute.\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "\u00a0announced Jan.21 that its subsidiary SoCal Biomethane will officially commission operations at the Victor Valley Wastewater Reclamation Authority () facility in Victorville, California. The facility is the first wastewater treatment plant in California to inject renewable natural gas made from both wastewater solids and food waste into a utility pipeline.The Anaergia subsidiary upgraded VVRWA\u2019s existing wastewater treatment plant, retrofitting existing anaerobic digesters with Anaergia\u2019s high-throughput and high-efficiency Omnivore technology and Anaergia\u2019s biogas conditioning and upgrading technology package that produces pipeline-quality\u00a0\u00a0(RNG). The additional technologies allow the facility to not only process wastewater, but also take in food waste collected by the region\u2019s waste haulers, preventing methane emissions from these sources and creating renewable, carbon-negative fuel to replace fossil natural gas. The facility will be capable of producing and injecting up to 320,000 MMBTU of RNG into the region\u2019s gas utility pipeline each year.The new plant will assist local municipalities in complying with California\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0regulations, which require every municipality to divert residents\u2019 and businesses\u2019 food and other organic waste from landfills, with the goal of reducing the amount of organic waste landfilled by 75 percent by 2025.Anaergia delivered this project as a public-private-partnership (P3) building this state-of-the-art infrastructure with financing partners North Sky Capital and Live Oak Bank, construction partner W.M. Lyles, and gas utility partner Southwest Gas. The P3 enabled the project to be delivered in record time and enhance VVWRA\u2019s wastewater infrastructure with greater capacity and resiliency.\u201cUnder Senate Bill 1383, every California municipality must now find a way to reduce food waste and other organic waste going to landfills. Anaergia offers a unique set of technologies that convert existing infrastructure at wastewater treatment plants into highly efficient systems capable of treating both wastewater residual solids as well as food waste,\u201d said Andrew Benedek, chairman and CEO of Anaergia. \u201cIn this way, existing infrastructure can be extended to serve new California requirements in a very efficient way. The net result is beneficial to all concerned, as it lowers the cost of operating a wastewater plant, helps the municipality meet the organic waste disposal requirements, and helps our planet by creating carbon-negative fuel. Our partnership with VVWRA is an example for the entire state on how to solve the current requirements efficiently.\u201d\u201cThe renewable natural gas being created here will be used as a carbon-negative transportation fuel to displace petroleum and to help California achieve its clean air and climate goals while supporting California clean tech jobs,\u201d said Richard W. Corey, executive officer, California Air Resources Board.\u201cPrivate investments in green innovations are helping us recycle more food and yard waste into valuable new products,\u201d CalRecycle Director Rachel Machi Wagoner said. \u201cThese strong partnerships are critical to growing California\u2019s circular economy and creating a safer climate.\u201d\u201cThese infrastructure improvements provide operational and capacity resiliency, greater operational flexibility and the increased digester capacity we\u2019ll need to serve the future growth of our community,\u201d said Bill Holland, chairman of the VVWRA Board. \u201cIn addition, the ability to process food waste and create RNG benefits our agency economically.\u201d\u201cHelping our customers and the communities we serve reduce emissions is very important to us. We are very proud of our collaboration with VVWRA to introduce RNG to the Southwest Gas system. This carbon-negative RNG flowing through our system will make a major difference,\u201d said Southwest Gas CEO John Hester. \u201cThe facility is slated to create enough renewable natural gas to offset the emissions of more than 2,000 homes each year. We are pleased to be part of this important project, which advances communities towards a clean-energy future.\u201dMethane has a far greater short-term effect in warming the planet than carbon dioxide. It has become a key focus in the battle against climate change because reducing methane emissions curbs the adverse impacts of climate change more significantly in the immediate term compared to carbon dioxide reductions.Landfills are\u00a0, according to flyover readings, and Senate Bill 1383 was designed to combat that issue. State agencies estimate that at least 50-100 new or expanded facilities will be needed to annually recycle the over 20 million tons of organic waste that will be collected from residents and commercial businesses and diverted from landfills as the law is implemented.Across the United States,\u00a0, yard clippings or paper/cardboard, much of which could be diverted from landfills and anaerobically digested to make RNG.\u00a0\u00a0"

Renewable fuel production is a strategic area of excellence for\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0and we are pleased to put forward our execution capabilities in support of the RNG project.\"\u00a0 The LRE Project has also executed a long-term operations and maintenance services agreement with SUEZ Water Technologies & Solutions, who provides similar services for anaerobic digester projects and waste water treatment projects throughout the world.The LRE project is designed to receive up to 1,400 tons per day of diverted organic waste which it will process into 3,300 dekatherms per day of renewable natural gas. This is the energy equivalent of 28,400 gallons of gasoline each day. The LRE project will have a direct interconnection to Elizabethtown Gas, a subsidiary of South Jersey Industries. The Project will also produce 260 cubic yards per day of a high value soil amendment material.\u00a0Ralph Daley, senior vice president of RNG Energy confirms, \"Virtually everything we receive would have gone to a landfill and, with this project, will now be converted to a high value renewable natural gas and soil amendment. This project provides the optimized sustainable solution for managing diverted organic waste.\"The project will also use 3.2 megawatts (MW) of Bloom Energy solid oxide fuel cells to provide primary power for the facility and digester, bolster energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, and optimize power generation costs. RNG Energy and Bloom completed a separate 6MW project on Long Island in 2020.\u00a0 Potter notes, \"We are maximizing the application of every possible viable technology to provide the optimized sustainable waste management and RNG production solutions for our partners. This is what our customers expect. The LRE project will be one of the largest carbon reduction resources in the state of\u00a0New Jersey.\"Significant site work has already been completed with the elevation of the site being increased by a remarkable 7 feet and construction of 1,600 feet of new bulkhead along the Arthur Kill and Rahway Rivers.The LRE Project includes development and construction of multiple off-site food waste preprocessing and depackaging operations to be located in\u00a0New York City,\u00a0New York state\u00a0and\u00a0New Jersey.The LRE Project will provide a sustainable and competitive waste management service within a 40mile metro region with over 18 million residents. The same region has implemented aggressive organic waste diversion regulations that need a sustainable anaerobic digestion project solution. Potter notes, \"We are not aware of any project site within this proximity to\u00a0NYC\u00a0that affords the superior capacity to receive barges combined with close proximity to the I-95 transportation corridor. These optimized transportation logistics make the project the preferred low carbon and low-cost provider of organic waste management services.\"\"The\u00a0City of Linden\u00a0has been a proud host community for the Project,\" states\u00a0Linden\u00a0Mayor Armstead. \"This is another in a long list of renewable energy projects that the City has completed. We have supported the LRE Project throughout the development phase and we definitely appreciate the investment in our City and the hundreds of union construction jobs that come with it. This is a long-term renewable and sustainable solution to waste management and we look forward to our continued association with the Project and its sponsors.\"\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "Valero Energy Corp. released fourth quarter financial results on Jan. 27, reporting the Diamond Green Diesel expansion project was completed ahead of schedule. The company also reported strong results for its ethanol segment.Valero\u2019s renewable diesel segment, which consists of the DGD joint venture, reported $150 million of operating income for the fourth quarter of 2021, up from $127 million during the same period of the previous year.Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 1.6 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2021, up 974,000 gallons per day when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Valero primarily attributed the higher operating income and sales volumes to the startup of the DGD expansion project at the company\u2019s St. Charles refinery in Norco, Louisiana, during the fourth quarter.According to Valero, that expansion project at\u2014referred to as DGD 2\u2014commenced operations during the final quarter of 2021 on-budget and ahead of schedule. The expansion project was designed to boost production capacity at the site by 400 MMgy, bringing total capacity at the St. Charles facility to 690 MMgy of renewable diesel and 30 MMgy of renewable naphtha. Due to process and improvement and optimization, the expansion project actually boosted production capacity by 410 MMgy with the St. Charles facility now able to produce 700 MMgy of renewable diesel.DGD is also working to develop a renewable diesel plant at Valero\u2019s Port Arthur refinery in Texas, referred to as DGD 3. Development of that facility, which is expected to have a renewable diesel production capacity of 470 MMgy, is also progressing ahead of schedule and is now expected to commence operations in the first quarter of 2023. Once operational, that facility will boost DGD\u2019s total production capacity to 1.2 billion gallons per year of renewable diesel and 50 MMgy of renewable naphtha.Valero\u2019s ethanol segment reported $474 million of operating income for the fourth quarter of last year, up from $15 million during the same period of 2020. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.4 million gallons per day for the fourth quarter, 278,000 gallons per day higher than in the same period of the previous year. The company primarily attributed the growth in operating income to higher ethanol product prices.Valero reported that the large-scale carbon sequestration project under development by Black Rock and Navigator is progressing on scheduled and still expected to begin startup activities in late 2024. Valero is expected to be the anchor shipper of carbon dioxide, with eight of its ethanol plants connected to the system. The carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) project is expected to lower the carbon intensity (CI) score of ethanol produced at those eight plants, resulting in higher product margin.Moving into 2022, Homer Bhullar, vice president of investor relations and finance at Valero, said the company expects full-year sales volumes for renewable diesel to be approximately 700 million gallons with operating expenses of approximately 45 cents per gallon. The ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.2 million gallons per day with operating expenses at 44 cents per gallon.\u00a0"

Because dairy manure left in lagoons and used as fertilizer releases high levels of methane to the atmosphere, there is an opportunity to capture that methane as biogas and refine it to be used as renewable natural gas. Doing so has no impact of the fertilizer and nutrients available, yet creates more options to sustainably manage fertilizers for sustainable farming practices. That kind of smart thinking and waste reduction is a cornerstone of the circular economy at the core of Gevo\u2019s business model.As\u00a0, the RNG is expected to be sold into the California market under dispensing agreements BP has in place with Clean Energy Fuels Corp., the largest fueling infrastructure in the U.S. for RNG. The facility is expected to lead to $9 million to $16 million a year of distributions from the project expected to begin in late 2022, or early 2023 depending on the timing of the California Air Resources Board\u2019s (CARB) Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). It is anticipated that NW Iowa RNG will benefit from environmental product revenues under California\u2019s LCFS program and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard program. RNG-fueled vehicles are estimated to result in up to 95 percent lower emissions than those fueled by gasoline or diesel on a lifecycle basis, according to a\u00a0.\u201cThe farmers have demonstrated that they are willing to try something new,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cBy creating a renewable energy source that reduces the greenhouse gas footprint of agriculture while providing meaningful renewable energy where its badly needed\u2014that kind of foresight will make a difference in the long term far beyond Northwest Iowa.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "The U.S. EPA released a final rule on Jan. 28 extending and modifying certain Renewable Fuel Standard compliance deadlines. Representatives of the biofuels industry are criticizing the EPA\u2019s actions and calling for the agency to get the RFS back on track.The rule extends the RFS compliance deadline for the 2109 compliance year for small refineries only. The new 2019 compliance deadline for small refineries will be the next quarterly reporting deadline after the effective date of the 2021 RFS standards.The rule extends the 2020, 2021 and 2022 compliance deadlines for all parties, with the 2020 compliance deadline set at the next quarterly reporting deadline after the 2019 compliance deadline for small refineries. The 2021 compliance deadline will be the next quarterly reporting deadline after the 2020 compliance deadline. The rule sets the 2022 compliance deadline at the next quarterly reporting deadline after either the effective date of the 2023 RFS standards or the 2021 compliance deadline, whichever is later.For compliance years 2019-2022, the rule extends the associated attest engagement reporting deadlines to the next June 1 attest engagement reporting deadline after the applicable 2019-2022 compliance deadline.For compliance years 2023 and later, the EPA has changed the way RFS compliance and attest engagement report deadlines are set. According to the agency, the annual compliance reporting deadline will be set at the latest date of three options, including March 31 of the subsequent calendar year, the next quarterly reporting deadline after the effective date of the final rule establishing the subsequent compliance year\u2019s RFS standards, or the next quarterly reporting deadline after the annual compliance reporting deadline for the prior compliance year. The annual attest engagement reporting deadline will be set the latest date of two options, either June 1 of the subsequent calendar year or the next June 1 attest engagement reporting deadline after the annual compliance reporting deadline.According to the EPA, the deadline changes \u201cwill help ensure that obligated parties are positioned to fully comply with their RFS obligations by ensuring that each year\u2019s compliance deadline falls after the standards for the subsequent compliance year are known.\u201d The agency also said its new approach to deadlines for 2023 and later compliance years will avoid the agency from \u201chaving to repeatedly extend compliance deadlines for obligated parties should promulgation of the subsequent year\u2019s standards be delayed.\u201dGrowth Energy has criticized the compliance deadline delays and is calling on the EPA to get the RFS back on track. \u201cDelaying compliance deadlines is completely contradictory to efforts to lower rising gas prices and increase the use of cleaner, lower-carbon fuels,\u201d said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. \u201cBy continuing to delay compliance deadlines, EPA is creating uncertainty in the marketplace and stunting the blending of biofuel needed to decarbonize transportation as the Renewable Fuel Standard intended.\u201cMoving ahead, it is vital for EPA to get the RFS back on track. EPA can start by making needed changes to its proposed cuts to the 2020 RVOs and low volumes for 2021,\u201d Skor continued. \u201cImportantly, EPA needs to swiftly finalize the proposed volumes for 2022. Administrator Regan has emphasized time and time again the need for transparency and certainty when it comes to the RFS. Ensuring timely compliance and finalizing strong biofuel blends can help Administrator Regan follow through on these promises and provide much needed certainty for biofuel producers.\u201dThe Renewable Fuels Association is also speaking out against the EPA\u2019s action on RFS deadlines. \u201cToday\u2019s action by EPA is very disappointing, and we are especially concerned by the new approach the agency is taking to future RFS compliance deadlines,\u201d said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. \u201cWith this final rule, EPA just gave itself the power to perpetually delay implementation of yearly RFS blending requirements and continually kick the can down the road on compliance deadlines. This is not what Congress intended, and this approach could exacerbate the uncertainty and instability around RFS implementation that was created by the past administration. Ethanol producers, farmers, fuel retailers, and refiners need and deserve certainty and predictability when it comes to RFS implementation timelines. That\u2019s why Congress put certain annual deadlines into the law for RFS implementation.\u201dAdditional information, including a full copy of the final rule, is available on the EPA\u2019s .\u00a0\u00a0"

The public comment period on the proposed rule closes Feb. 4. A separate comment period on the agency\u2019s proposal to deny more than 60 small refinery exemptions (SREs) closes Feb. 7.The EPA to revise existing 2020 RVOs and set new RVOs for 2021 and 2022 on Dec. 7.For 2020, the EPA is proposing to reduce the total RVO for renewable fuel to 17.13 billion gallons, down from 20.09 billion gallons\u00a0. The nested RVO for advanced biofuel would be set at 4.63 billion gallons, down from 5.09 billion. The RVO for biomass-based diesel would be maintained at 2.43 billion gallons, while the cellulosic biofuel RVO would be set at 510 million gallons, down from 590 million gallons. The agency said it is proposing to revise 2020 RVOs to account for challenges the program and the market faced during the year, including from the COVID-19 pandemic.For 2021, the EPA is proposing to set the RVO for total renewable fuel at 18.52 billion gallons, including 5.2 billion gallons of advanced biofuel, 2.43 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel, and 620 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel. The EPA said the 2021 RVOs are being proposed at the level the agency projects the market used during the 2021 calendar year.For 2022, the EPA is proposing to set the RVO for total renewable fuel at 20.77 billion gallons, including 5.77 billion gallons of advanced biofuel, 2.76 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel, and 770 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel. The agency is also proposing to add a 250-million-gallon supplemental obligation and has stated its intent to add another 250-million-gallon supplemental obligation in 2023. The supplemental obligations would address the remand of the 2014-2016 annual rule by the D.C. Court of Appeals in Americans for Clean Energy v. EPA. The agency said spreading the obligation over two years would provide the market time to respond to the supplemental obligation.The RVO rule also includes a variety of other provisions, including language to allow for the production, transfer and use of biointermediates to generate qualifying fuel under the RFS program. In addition the proposal includes provisions to change the biomass-based diesel weighting factor from 1.50 to 1.55, changes to registration for baseline volumes, changes to attest engagements for parties owning renewable identification numbers (RINs), the treatment of confidential business information, clarifying the definition of agricultural digesters and several other changes and minor corrections.In the SRE proposal, the EPA proposes to deny more than 60 pending SREs from small refineries seeking exemptions from the RFS program for one or more compliance years between 2016 and 2021. The agency said the proposed decision results from its review of the pending SRE petitions and supporting information, its legal, technical and policy analysis of the Clean Air Act provisions related to small refineries, and its application of the holding of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Renewable Fuels Association et al. v. EPA. \u00a0Members of the public can file comments on the RVO proposed rule through Feb. 4 on the  \u00a0website under Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0324. According to data posted to the Federal Register, 543 public comments have already been filed on the proposed rule.Comments on the SRE proposal can be filed through Feb. 7 on  under Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0566. According to the Federal Register, members of the public have filed 102 comments on the SRE proposal to date.\u00a0\u00a0"
