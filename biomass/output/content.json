    "text": "The U.S. EPA has announced it will host a virtual public workshop on greenhouse gas (GHG) modeling for biofuels on Feb. 28 through March 1. The agency is hosting the workshop to solicit information on the current scientific understanding of GHG modeling of land-based crop biofuels used in the transportation sector.Information gathered through the event will be used to inform a range of current and future actions, including EPA\u2019s methodology for quantifying GHGs under the Renewable Fuel Standard. Through the workshop, the agency said it will initiate a public process for getting input on how to incorporate the best available science into an update of its lifecycle analysis of biofuels. The event will also help the EPA determine what steps it should take next in this work area.The EPA is specifically seeking public comments on what sources of data exist and how they can be used to inform the assumptions that drive GHG estimates; how best to characterize the sources of uncertainty associated with quantifying the GHG emissions associated with biofuels; and what models are available to evaluate the lifecycle GHG emissions of land-based biofuels and whether those models meet Clean Air Act requirements for quantifying the direct and significant indirect emissions from biofuels.The workshop is being conducted by EPA\u2019s Office of Transportation and Air Quality in consultation with the USDA and the U.S. Department of Energy. The agency will also accept written comments through April 1. Additional information, including a link to register for the two-day workshop, is available on the EPA .\u00a0"

    "text": "In partnership with Enbridge Gas, the Canadian Urban Transit Research & Innovation Consortium (CUTRIC) is proud to launch three holistic studies comparing buses powered with renewable natural gas (RNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), and diesel fuel.Conducted separately for Calgary Transit, Orange County Transportation Authority, and TransLink, these four-month projects analyze factors ranging from fuel usage and vehicle maintenance to the total cost of ownership and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on differing propulsion fuels in transit buses. Each project delivers a comprehensive review of existing CNG and RNG applications across Canadian and U.S. transit fleets, and determines total emissions based on transit fleet data from selected samples and average values.\u201cWith thousands of RNG-fuelled buses already operating in transit fleets across the United States, CUTRIC\u2019s comparative analysis will determine whether RNG can quickly enable carbon-neutral mobility in Calgary, Orange County and across B.C., without sacrificing performance, reliability or range,\u201d said CUTRIC President and CEO Josipa Petrunic. \u201cThe drive to eliminate emissions is rightly focused on the integration of new technologies, such as battery electric buses (BEBs) and hydrogen fuel-cell electric buses (FCEBs). But RNG is often overlooked as another easily accessible, available and simple net zero emissions alternative fuel for Canadian transit agencies today. Our study will show the extent to which RNG can support the drive-to-zero emissions today.\u201dRNG can play a vital role in reducing transit emissions by drastically reducing the cost and complexity of transitioning to zero emission buses (ZEBs). It is interchangeable with the conventional natural gas used in existing and conventional CNG buses. It can be transported through existing pipeline systems to transit agency facilities using regular gas nomination and scheduling processes.\u201cHeavy transportation is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The good news is we can decarbonize heavy transport effectively today through CNG, a market-ready practical solution which offers significant GHG and cost advantages as compared to diesel, and incorporating RNG generated from organic waste, you can get to zero emissions,\u201d said Malini Giridhar, vice president of business development and regulatory, Enbridge Gas.A new CNG bus fueled by RNG costs about the same as a regular diesel bus, as does its fueling system, making it a cost-effective alternative for transit agencies struggling with the costs and complexities of decarbonization.\u201cRNG is a key element of TransLink\u2019s Low Carbon Fleet Strategy. For us, RNG is a win-win: it is a cost-effective alternative to diesel and significantly reduces our fleet CO2 emissions. Its local production from agricultural and municipal waste also supports a circular, low carbon economy,\u201d said Ralf Nielsen, director \u2013 enterprise sustainability, TransLink.With roughly 825 CNG buses on Canadian roads today, and with Canada\u2019s 10 operating RNG production facilities soon to be joined by another 230 that are in development, or under construction in Ontario alone, the technology is able to help displace diesel, one of the most carbon-intensive and costly fuels in the marketplace. This has already happened across the United States, where RNG-fuelled buses are operating in transit fleets of all sizes, including Los Angeles Metro and New York City Transit.\u201cAs Canadians, transit agencies and governments rally to fight climate change and recover from the pandemic. It\u2019s time for an all-hands-on-deck approach to reducing emissions,\u201d Petrunic said. \u201cThis means using all the tools in our toolkit to combat pollution. RNG is one of those tools.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "\u00a0announced Jan.21 that its subsidiary SoCal Biomethane will officially commission operations at the Victor Valley Wastewater Reclamation Authority () facility in Victorville, California. The facility is the first wastewater treatment plant in California to inject renewable natural gas made from both wastewater solids and food waste into a utility pipeline.The Anaergia subsidiary upgraded VVRWA\u2019s existing wastewater treatment plant, retrofitting existing anaerobic digesters with Anaergia\u2019s high-throughput and high-efficiency Omnivore technology and Anaergia\u2019s biogas conditioning and upgrading technology package that produces pipeline-quality\u00a0\u00a0(RNG). The additional technologies allow the facility to not only process wastewater, but also take in food waste collected by the region\u2019s waste haulers, preventing methane emissions from these sources and creating renewable, carbon-negative fuel to replace fossil natural gas. The facility will be capable of producing and injecting up to 320,000 MMBTU of RNG into the region\u2019s gas utility pipeline each year.The new plant will assist local municipalities in complying with California\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0regulations, which require every municipality to divert residents\u2019 and businesses\u2019 food and other organic waste from landfills, with the goal of reducing the amount of organic waste landfilled by 75 percent by 2025.Anaergia delivered this project as a public-private-partnership (P3) building this state-of-the-art infrastructure with financing partners North Sky Capital and Live Oak Bank, construction partner W.M. Lyles, and gas utility partner Southwest Gas. The P3 enabled the project to be delivered in record time and enhance VVWRA\u2019s wastewater infrastructure with greater capacity and resiliency.\u201cUnder Senate Bill 1383, every California municipality must now find a way to reduce food waste and other organic waste going to landfills. Anaergia offers a unique set of technologies that convert existing infrastructure at wastewater treatment plants into highly efficient systems capable of treating both wastewater residual solids as well as food waste,\u201d said Andrew Benedek, chairman and CEO of Anaergia. \u201cIn this way, existing infrastructure can be extended to serve new California requirements in a very efficient way. The net result is beneficial to all concerned, as it lowers the cost of operating a wastewater plant, helps the municipality meet the organic waste disposal requirements, and helps our planet by creating carbon-negative fuel. Our partnership with VVWRA is an example for the entire state on how to solve the current requirements efficiently.\u201d\u201cThe renewable natural gas being created here will be used as a carbon-negative transportation fuel to displace petroleum and to help California achieve its clean air and climate goals while supporting California clean tech jobs,\u201d said Richard W. Corey, executive officer, California Air Resources Board.\u201cPrivate investments in green innovations are helping us recycle more food and yard waste into valuable new products,\u201d CalRecycle Director Rachel Machi Wagoner said. \u201cThese strong partnerships are critical to growing California\u2019s circular economy and creating a safer climate.\u201d\u201cThese infrastructure improvements provide operational and capacity resiliency, greater operational flexibility and the increased digester capacity we\u2019ll need to serve the future growth of our community,\u201d said Bill Holland, chairman of the VVWRA Board. \u201cIn addition, the ability to process food waste and create RNG benefits our agency economically.\u201d\u201cHelping our customers and the communities we serve reduce emissions is very important to us. We are very proud of our collaboration with VVWRA to introduce RNG to the Southwest Gas system. This carbon-negative RNG flowing through our system will make a major difference,\u201d said Southwest Gas CEO John Hester. \u201cThe facility is slated to create enough renewable natural gas to offset the emissions of more than 2,000 homes each year. We are pleased to be part of this important project, which advances communities towards a clean-energy future.\u201dMethane has a far greater short-term effect in warming the planet than carbon dioxide. It has become a key focus in the battle against climate change because reducing methane emissions curbs the adverse impacts of climate change more significantly in the immediate term compared to carbon dioxide reductions.Landfills are\u00a0, according to flyover readings, and Senate Bill 1383 was designed to combat that issue. State agencies estimate that at least 50-100 new or expanded facilities will be needed to annually recycle the over 20 million tons of organic waste that will be collected from residents and commercial businesses and diverted from landfills as the law is implemented.Across the United States,\u00a0, yard clippings or paper/cardboard, much of which could be diverted from landfills and anaerobically digested to make RNG.\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "UGI Corp. announced today that it has entered into a 15-year agreement with\u00a0California-based technology developer, Vertimass, to utilize their catalytic technology to produce renewable fuels from renewable-ethanol in the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0and\u00a0Europe.The agreement centers on the development of production facilities using Vertimass\u2019 catalytic technology to convert renewable ethanol into renewable-propane and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The technology enables flexible production of the renewable fuels to align with regional market demand. Up to 50 percent of the total production capacity from the facilities can be renewable-propane that will support UGI\u2019s ongoing efforts to provide innovative, low-carbon, sustainable energy solutions to its customers.UGI expects to invest either solely, jointly with Vertimass or in partnership with third parties to build and operate multiple production facilities over the next 15 years in locations across the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0and\u00a0Europe, significantly increasing the supply of renewable-propane and SAF. UGI anticipates a total investment of roughly\u00a0$500 million\u00a0for the bolt-on production facilities over a 15-year period, including potential third-party investment, with total production target from these aggregated facilities of approximately 1 billion gallons of combined renewable fuels per annum. The goal is to have the first production facility onstream in fiscal year 2024 with an annual production target of approximately 50 million gallons of combined renewable fuels.Vertimass employs catalytic technology to convert renewable ethanol and other renewable alcohols into renewable hydrocarbon fuels that are compatible with the existing equipment and infrastructure. This technology can be bolted on to existing ethanol production facilities, optimizing GHG emissions reduction, and bringing further end product diversification to the existing ethanol producer. The introduction of such ethanol-based \u201cbio-refineries\u201d is an attractive proposition for skilled job development and the opportunity to further drive energy independence using local resources.\u201cThis is another significant milestone in our commitment to providing renewable fuels to our customers,\u201d said\u00a0Roger Perreault, president and CEO of\u00a0UGI Corp. \u201cOur business development team continues to seek out innovative opportunities and I am delighted with our newly established partnership with Vertimass. We believe this partnership will deliver significant renewable LPG for our customers as well as bring investment opportunity to interested stakeholders.\u201dCharles Wyman, Vertimass president and CEO, continued \u201cVertimass is extremely excited to work with UGI to commercialize our breakthrough technology. UGI and Vertimass have built strong relationships over the last year, which we believe will cement success.\u201d\u00a0Bill Shopoff, Vertimass chair, noted \u201cTogether we will take advantage of this unique low-cost technology to transform ethanol facilities and produce renewable fuels that will cover UGI\u2019s global footprint, as well as enable the production of SAF.\u201dVertimass is developing a unique consolidated alcohol deoxygenation and oligomerization (CADO) technology to allow ethanol producers to 1) produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and diesel blendstocks that are compatible with the current transportation fuel infrastructure as well as LPG (liquified petroleum gases, mainly propane and butane), 2) eliminate the ethanol \u201cblend wall\u201d by converting ethanol into fungible gasoline components for powering light duty vehicles, 3) produce intermediates used to make plastics and other higher value products, and 4) possibly debottleneck processes to increase throughput with little additional costs other than for feedstock. CADO completely converts wet ethanol (and other alcohols) into targeted hydrocarbons in a simple reactor system at moderate temperatures and near atmospheric pressure without adding hydrogen. Other benefits include the ability to lower plant water usage, reduce overall energy consumption, and drop GHG emissions to levels required for the Renewable Fuel Standard advanced biofuel category.Renewable LPG, also known as renewable-propane, is chemically identical to today\u2019s fossil LPG (CH) and therefore can be used with existing infrastructure. It has up to 80 percent lower carbon footprint than that of conventional LPG.\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "Johnson Matthey, a global leader in sustainable technologies, has launched an innovative technology \u2013\u00a0HyCOgen\u00a0\u2013 designed to play a pivotal role in enabling the conversion of captured carbon dioxide (CO) and green hydrogen into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). By combining\u00a0HyCOgen\u00a0with the award-winning FT\u00a0CANS\u00a0Fischer Tropsch technology (developed in collaboration with bp),\u00a0Johnson Matthey\u00a0offers an integrated, scalable solution for use in the efficient and cost-effective production of renewable power based SAF.HyCOgen,\u00a0Johnson Matthey's\u00a0Reverse Water Gas Shift technology, is a catalyzed process to convert green hydrogen and COinto carbon monoxide (CO), which is combined with additional hydrogen to form synthesis gas (syngas), a crucial building block in the manufacture of fuels and chemicals. The integration with the FT\u00a0CANS\u00a0technology provides an end to end, optimized and highly scalable process that turns over 95 percent of the CO\u00a0into high quality synthetic crude oil. This synthetic crude oil can be further upgraded into sustainable drop-in fuel products including aviation fuels, renewable diesel and naphtha.The scalability of the integrated\u00a0HyCOgen/FT\u00a0CANS\u00a0solution enables cost-effective deployment across a wide range of project sizes \u2013 from small-scale, fed by hydrogen from a single electrolyzer, through to world-scale with multiple large electrolyzer modules.The global aviation industry is responsible for 12 percent\u00a0of transport related COemissions, therefore substantial production of low carbon intensity SAF is essential to mitigate emissions. Both the EUand U.S.\u00a0are setting bold targets for its scale up and blending, and this is expected to increase SAF demand significantly.\u00a0Johnson Matthey's\u00a0HyCOgen\u00a0solution, along with the FT\u00a0CANS\u00a0technology, can help increase the supply of SAF through its efficient production at scale.Jane Toogood, sector chief executive,\u00a0Johnson Matthey, commented, \"Given the challenges associated with new propulsion technologies and airport infrastructure, plus the long asset life of aircraft, there are significant hurdles in moving from hydrocarbon-based aviation fuel to alternatives such as battery electric or hydrogen. This is where\u00a0Johnson Matthey's\u00a0longstanding expertise and market-leading position in syngas generation technology can play a crucial role, by providing solutions that enable the production of sustainable drop-in fuels that are deployable today.\"By combining\u00a0HyCOgen\u00a0with FT\u00a0CANS, we can now deliver customers a cost-efficient, reliable and scalable technology to help increase SAF production, backed by our track record of successful technology development and commercialization.\"The integrated\u00a0HyCOgen/FT\u00a0CANS\u00a0solution is available now from\u00a0Johnson Matthey.\u00a0\u00a0"

The\u00a0Union County\u00a0plant can accept swine manure, poultry litter, food processing byproduct, and agricultural row crops as feedstock.\u00a0This\u00a0plant is designed to\u00a0initially\u00a0produce up to 200,000 MMBtus of biogas per year,\u00a0scaling\u00a0up to 500,000 MMBtus per year.\u00a0The Bladen County\u00a0plant\u00a0will collect swine manure and poultry litter from multiple surrounding farms, with initial production estimates\u00a0between 160,000 and 200,000 MMBtus of biogas per year, scaling up to 500,000 MMBtus per year.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0GESS RNG Biogas\u00a0is\u00a0finalizing\u00a0two dairy\u00a0projects. The first,\u00a0in\u00a0Grand Rapids, Michigan,\u00a0will have 8,000 wet\u00a0cow\u00a0equivalent, producing up to 150,000 MMBtus of biogas per year. The second, in Syracuse, Kansas,\u00a0will have 16,000 wet\u00a0cow\u00a0equivalent, producing up to 300,000 MMBtus of biogas per year.\u00a0On all projects,\u00a0GESS RNG Biogas's\u00a0sister company,\u00a0Cyclum\u00a0Renewables LLC\u00a0, will be installing renewable microgrids.\u00a0These microgrids will allow sites\u00a0to utilize RNG, Biodiesel, and EV trucks, which can be fueled on-site,\u00a0while also producing each\u00a0biogas plant's\u00a0electricity. These measures will minimize the Carbon Intensity\u00a0score of each plant, allowing the fuel we produce to be as sustainable as possible.\u00a0Cyclum\u00a0has agreed to offtake a certain portion of this\u00a0RNG\u00a0for use in fuel production at its\u00a0coming\u00a0renewable fuel truck stops.\u00a0GESS RNG Biogas\u00a0USA's\u00a0Lathan Welker\u00a0stated, \"we are\u00a0proud to pioneer\u00a0technologies that improve on the shortcomings of\u00a0older methods, in terms of\u00a0both\u00a0efficiency\u00a0and environmental responsibility.\u00a0In doing so, GESS RNG Biogas hopes to continue to produce the lowest-carbon biogas possible.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Moving forward, however, FutureMetrics is predicting that future increased demand will come from large utility power stations.A white paper authored by FutureMetrics President William Strauss in December discusses aggressive goals Japan has set for reducing its carbon dioxide emissions. The paper explains that to reach the goals, Japan will have to achieve a massive decline in coal-fueled generation while more than doubling power generation from renewables to 37 percent by 2030.\u201cThese goals and challenges suggest that there will be a need for on-demand power generation both to balance the variability and intermittency of wind and solar generation, and to replace the baseload characteristics of coal generation,\u201d Strauss wrote. \u201cThe need for carbon beneficial baseload power will become even more pressing if nuclear generation does not reach the goal of 21 percent of the total.\u201dStrauss stresses that modifying or converting existing pulverize coal generation units to use pellet fuel offers a relatively low-cost solution to boost renewables generation without degrading the existing plant\u2019s reliability or output rating.The white paper calculates the volume of wood pellet fuel that would be needed on an annual basis to meet national goals under a variety of scenarios.

    "text": "Waga Energy is joining forces with Steuben County, New York, on a renewable natural gas (RNG) project at the county's Bath landfill. The RNG produced will be injected in the local grid and used as a biofuel to decarbonize mobility. The Steuben County landfill will be the first in the U.S. to adopt Waga Energy's WAGABOXtechnology, already in use at 10 landfills with an additional 11 facilities forthcoming in Europe and North America.On Dec. 30, 2021, Waga Energy, a European expert in the production of RNG from landfill gas, signed a contract with Steuben County, New York, for the development of an RNG project at a municipal solid waste landfill located in the town of Bath.Waga Energy will build a landfill gas upgrading unit using its patented WAGABOX technology. Once completed, the unit will produce grid compliant RNG (also known as biomethane) from the methane generated by the decomposition of the waste in the landfill.The WAGABOX unit will be commissioned by March 2023. It will purify 1,000 standard cubic feet per minute (1,600 cubic meters per hour) of raw landfill gas to deliver 207,000 mmBtu (60 GWh) of RNG. The facility will produce RNG that can be used for residential consumption or as a transportation fuel, equivalent to supplying around 4,000 homes with clean, local, and renewable energy, saving an estimated 13,500tons of carbon dioxide per year.Waga Energy will fund, build, operate and maintain the WAGABOX unit under a 20-year landfill gas supply contract with Steuben County. The entire facility will be built in North America, with the exception of one of the components of the cryogenic module that will be imported from France.Waga Energy will generate revenues by selling RNG to a private offtaker through a purchase agreement similar to the PPAs (power purchase agreements) commonly used for renewable electricity projects. The revenue generated by the project will be shared with Steuben County.Steuben County is home to approximately 99,000 residents, and its solid waste landfill in Bath is authorized to dispose of 150,000 tons of waste per year. In July 2020 the County issued a competitive RFP (request for proposals) for a landfill gas utilization project to collect and upgrade the gas which is currently flared.WAGABOX is a breakthrough technology for upgrading landfill gas into grid compliant RNG. The result of fifteen years of research and development, the technology combines membrane filtration and cryogenic distillation to separate methane from landfill gas. Over the last five years, 10 WAGABOX facilities have been commissioned in France. An additional 11 projects-eight in France, one in Spain, and two in Canada-are under construction. The Steuben County WAGABOX project is Waga Energy's first project in the United States.Waga Energy CEO and cofounder Mathieu Lefebvre said, \"We are honored to have been selected by Steuben County to upgrade the methane from its Bath landfill. This first contract in the United States marks a major milestone to introduce our WAGABOX(R) solution to the US market. We are eager for landfill operators in the United States to see how efficient our technology is, and how our hassle-free operating model can help small and medium-sized landfills generate additional revenues while taking concrete action against climate change.\"Steuben County Manager Jack Wheeler said, \"Steuben County is thrilled to partner with Waga Energy in leveraging landfill gas in an environmentally conscious and economically advantageous project. WagaEnergy has proven to be a highly innovative international firm and bringing this collaboration to fruition will benefit Steuben County and our region for many years to come.\"\u00a0\u00a0"

This new supply of SAF supports ACI Jet\u2019s customers who are looking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions immediately and significantly.\u00a0\u201cWe are excited to provide our Orange County customers with a sustainable fuel option and to support progress toward a future of renewable energy in aviation,\u201d said Andrew Robillard, vice president of ACI Jet FBOs and facilities.SAF is the most effective way to reduce a flight\u2019s carbon footprint. To quantify its benefit, each truckload (approximately 8,000 gallons) of SAF Avfuel supplies to the FBO provides a 19 metric ton reduction in carbon emissions over its lifecycle. This provides the same climate benefit as reducing the emissions from 4.1 passenger vehicles to zero over the course of a year.In the future, SAF could deliver up to 80 perent less greenhouse gas emissions over its lifecycle versus traditional jet fuel if used in its neat, concentrated form.Keith Sawyer, Avfuel\u2019s manager of alternative fuels, said, \u201cAvfuel is proud to yet again work with ACI Jet on sustainability initiatives. Its team was one of the first to provide Avfuel\u2019s , and we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled to expand this offering with a consistent supply of SAF to the Orange County community. The result is a real, measurable difference in carbon emissions for sustainability-minded organizations.\u201dNeste MY SAF is made from sustainably sourced, renewable waste and residue materials\u2014such as used cooking oil. It is a fully approved drop-in fuel that, once blended with petroleum jet fuel, meets ASTM D-1655 specification for conventional jet fuel and performance standards under all operating conditions. This makes Neste MY SAF an optimum solution to directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft, requiring no new investments, modifications or changes to the aircraft, fuel distribution procedures or airport fuel storage tanks.\u00a0"

When factoring in the upstream emissions of making and delivering the R99 to TriMet\u2019s facilities, the move to R99 will lower the greenhouse gas emissions from TriMet\u2019s fixed-route bus fleet by about 61 percent compared to the biodiesel blend we had been using.\u201cWhether riding on a TriMet bus, driving behind it or walking or biking nearby, you\u2019ll notice a big difference with our buses now running on cleaner-burning renewable diesel,\u201d said TriMet General Manager Sam Desue Jr. \u201cAs Oregon\u2019s largest consumer of diesel before today, we\u2019re not only lowering TriMet\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, we\u2019re leading the state\u2019s transportation industry toward a cleaner air future right now.\u201dTriMet\u2019s switch to a renewable diesel blend is coupled with our switch to renewable electricity in June 2021. The combined efforts have reduced our carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by more than half\u201463 percent\u2014in six months\u2019 time. *TriMet expects to avoid more than 155 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions every year. That\u2019s the equivalent of taking more than 15,000 cars off the road. \u201cFor Oregon to step up, be a model, and convince the rest of the nation to join the fight against climate change, we need to get serious about reducing our transportation emissions, the largest source of emissions in this state,\u201d said Oregon State Sen. Michael Dembrow.\u00a0\u201cTo do that, we need more people to be using transit, and we need to make sure that the energy used to run those buses and trains are coming from renewable sources.\u00a0By switching to renewable electricity and renewable, green diesel, TriMet is making a huge difference in moving us forward. I\u2019m so proud of this decision.\u201d\u201cTriMet\u2019s shift to renewable diesel will help accelerate the shift from fossil fuels to clean fuels and cleaner air sooner, and for the sake of our rapidly changing climate, moving further, faster is how we will succeed,\u201d said Climate Solutions Oregon Director Meredith Connolly. \u201cIt\u2019s how we reflect our region\u2019s values and embrace a clean energy future. It\u2019s how we protect this incredibly special place we all call home.\u201d\u00a0On December 1,\u00a0\u00a0trucks pulled into TriMet\u2019s three bus operating facilities, delivering\u00a0, a low-carbon biofuel. The renewable diesel\u00a0, but it contains nearly no fossil carbon and performs better in cold air. It is made from 100% renewable and sustainable resources like natural fats, vegetable oils and greases.\u00a0, \u201cunlike fossil diesel, Neste MY Renewable Diesel contains no aromatics or impurities.\u201d Because of this, and based on a 2019 pilot of renewable diesel, TriMet expects to reduce maintenance costs by an estimated $100,000 a year.TriMet celebrated the shift to a cleaner burning fuel on Dec. \u00a02, with General Manager Sam Desue Jr. and Oregon Sen. Michael Dembrow\u2014a staunch proponent of reducing carbon emissions in the transportation industry\u2014fueling a bus with the R99 at TriMet\u2019s Powell Operations Facility in southeast Portland. The bus, a 60-foot articulated bus, will serve riders along the Division Street corridor between Portland and Gresham next fall once the Division Transit Project wraps up.General Manager Desue and Sen. Dembrow were joined by Metro Council President Lynn Peterson, Multnomah County Commissioner Jessica Vega-Pederson, Portland General Electric President and CEO Maria Pope and Climate Solutions\u2019 Oregon Director Meredith Connolly.\u201cCutting pollution, creating livable communities and improving safety \u2013 all of these things are critical to Metro\u2019s mission of supporting transit in greater Portland,\u201d said Metro Council President Lynn Peterson. \u201cBy switching to R99 diesel and electric buses, TriMet is making a commitment to reducing emissions and improving air quality in our transit corridors, supporting livability and health.\u201d\u201cToday is a huge day and a big step forward in our region\u2019s efforts to combat climate change and improve air quality,\u201d said Multnomah County Commissioner Jessica Vega Pederson. \u201cMultnomah County has always been on the cutting edge of addressing these same issues, and TriMet has and will continue to be a critical partner in those efforts. TriMet is stepping up with the transit system we need to carry us into a cleaner, brighter future. Now let\u2019s all get on board!\u201d\u201cCongratulations to TriMet on a major milestone in their journey to a clean energy future,\u201d said Portland General Electric President and CEO Maria Pope. \u201cTheir announcement today to switch to renewable fuel is a significant step forward.\u00a0 From the first electric bus route in Oregon to the first overhead gantry charger, we are proud to partner with them on their journey and power their facilities and electric buses with 100 percent renewable energy.\u201d\u00a0While TriMet\u2019s switch to renewable diesel is our latest effort to reduce our carbon footprint, it won\u2019t be our last. We are committed to move to a zero-emissions bus fleet by 2040.TriMet\u00a0\u00a0of our short-range electric buses back in 2019. In November, we\u00a0, which are meant to run all day and charge at night. We\u2019re also testing three 40-foot buses and an articulated 60-foot bus that were converted from diesel to all electric buses.More electric buses are on the way! Our plan is to add 24 more of these zero-emissions bus in our fiscal year 2024 that begins July 2023.Altogether, these and other efforts at TriMet are working toward the goal of a cleaner, healthier future starting today.

I\u2019m optimistic the private sector will help lead the way in innovation in this sector.\u201dThe program incentivizes the production of more than 30 specified chemicals derived from biomass feedstocks by giving eligible companies tax credits for their capital investment, job creation, and renewable chemical production.The program will share tax credits previously established for renewable diesel or biodiesel production in the commonwealth. The total amount of tax credit shall be 5 cents per molecular pound of weight of renewable chemicals produced in Kentucky by an eligible business, unless the total amount of approved credits for all taxpayers exceeds the annual cap of $10 million for the program.Kentucky developed the program to capitalize on its resources and infrastructure and to support the growth of the renewable chemical manufacturing industry. It addresses the unique opportunity to advance the state\u2019s economy by utilizing biomass feedstocks for the production of environmentally sustainable products.For the renewable chemical production tax credit, the bill, which was passed by the Kentucky legislature in 2020, states eligible renewable chemicals are limited to building block chemicals with a biobased content percentage of at least 50 percent, except for chemicals sold or used for the production of food, feed, or fuel.Program eligibility requirements for renewable chemicals, creation of jobs, or investment of new capital related to renewable chemical production, and reporting requirements for eligible companies are established by\u00a0.The Kentucky Department of Agriculture will help administer the program, coordinating with the\u00a0\u00a0in awarding the tax credits to eligible companies producing renewable chemicals.To be eligible for the renewable chemical production tax credit, a business must:\u2022Be      physically located in Kentucky;\u2022Operate      for profit;\u2022Organize,      expand, or locate in this state on or after July 1, 2020;\u2022Create      new jobs and retain those jobs for at least four years or invest a      substantial amount of new capital in the commonwealth and maintain that      capital for at least four years;\u2022Cannot      provide professional services, health care services, medical treatments,      or engage in retail operations and cannot relocate operations from another      area of Kentucky or reduce operations in another area of the state while      seeking this incentive.To find out more about Kentucky\u2019s Renewable Chemical Production Program or to request an application, contact Tim Hughes at\u00a0.Complete applications along with the required $500 compliance fee must be filed with the Kentucky Department of Agriculture by Jan. 15, 2022.To learn more about the tax credit rate calculation, visit the Kentucky Department of Revenue\u2019s\u00a0.\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "Representatives of the biofuels industry called on the U.S. EPA to set strong Renewable Fuel Standard blending requirements and abandon plans to retroactively reduce the 2020 renewable volume obligation (RVO) during a Jan. 4 hearing held by the agency to gather public comments on its pending proposed rule to set 2020, 2021 and 2022 RFS RVOs.The agency on Dec. 7 that aims to revise the 2020 RVO and set long-overdue RVOs for 2021 and 2022. A public comment period on the proposed rule is open through Feb. 4.For 2020, the EPA is proposing to reduce the total RVO for renewable fuel to 17.13 billion gallons, down from 20.09 billion gallons\u00a0. The nested RVO for advanced biofuel would be set at 4.63 billion gallons, down from 5.09 billion. The RVO for biomass-based diesel would be maintained at 2.43 billion gallons, while the cellulosic biofuel RVO would be set at 510 million gallons, down from 590 million gallons. The agency said it is proposing to revise 2020 RVOs to account for challenges the program and the market faced during the year, including from the COVID-19 pandemic.For 2021, the EPA is proposing to set the RVO for total renewable fuel at 18.52 billion gallons, including 5.2 billion gallons of advanced biofuel, 2.43 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel, and 620 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel. The EPA said the 2021 RVOs are being proposed at the level the agency projects the market will use by the end of this year.For 2022, the EPA is proposing to set the RVO for total renewable fuel at 20.77 billion gallons, including 5.77 billion gallons of advanced biofuel, 2.76 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel, and 770 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel. The agency is also proposing to add a 250-million-gallon supplemental obligation and has stated its intent to add another 250-million-gallon supplemental obligation in 2023. The supplemental obligations would address the remand of the 2014-2016 annual rule by the D.C. Court of Appeals in Americans for Clean Energy v. EPA. The agency said spreading the obligation over two years would provide the market time to respond to the supplemental obligation.During the hearing, theBiomass Power Association called on the EPA to stop overlooking the role the biomass power sector can play in reducing transportation emissions through the RFS. Even though renewable electricity is eligible to participate in the RFS, the agency has failed to take the necessary actions to allow biobased electricity producers to participate in the program.Carrie Annand, executive director of the BPA, stressed that the number of electric vehicles (EVs) on American roads has continued to grow and is expected to soar with the current administration\u2019s policies focused on EV adoption. \u201cIn 2011, there were only 16,000 EVs on U.S. roads; by 2021 more than 2 million cumulative EVs have been sold,\u201d she said. \u201cIn order for EVs to reach their full carbon savings potential, however, they need zero- and low-carbon feedstocks and clean power generating sources for charging. This will be even more important as economy-wide electrification gains momentum beyond transportation.\u201cThe great news is that this Administration has an opportunity to address these problems by approving electricity generating pathways into the Renewable Fuel program,\u201d Annand continued. \u201cBecause electricity is already supported under existing RFS regulations, Congressional action is not necessary. However, electricity in the RFS enjoys strong bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. We have been informed by officials at the Agency that they intend to announce a process that will support adoption, approval and registration of renewable electricity generating facilities. While we are disappointed that the agency did not include specific regulatory proposed language for electricity in the 2020, 2021 and 2022 RVO proposal released in December, we remain hopeful that the agency will issue a proposal that will finally support credit generation for renewable electricity under the program for 2023 and beyond.\u201d\u00a0In its testimony, the Renewable Fuels Association said the EPA is moving in the right direction on the RFS, but urged the agency to reconsider the proposed retroactive cuts to the 2020 RVO.\u201cRFA supports the proposed volumes for 2022 for all categories of renewable fuel, and we specifically commend EPA for proposing to set the implied requirement for conventional renewable fuels at the statutory level of 15 billion gallons,\u201d said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. \u201cWe also support EPA\u2019s proposal to account for projected exempt volumes from small refineries when setting RVO percentages. And, RFA agrees with EPA that, \u2018in the interest of transparency,\u2019 the agency should release basic information about entities seeking exemptions from RFS compliance.\u201d Cooper also voiced RFA\u2019s strong support for EPA\u2019s related proposal to deny 65 pending small refinery exemption petitions.Unfortunately, however, EPA\u2019s proposed RVO for 2021 misses the mark and the proposed retroactive revision of the 2020 RVO would set a \u201cdangerous precedent,\u201d Cooper said.\u201cAs for the 2021 RVO and the proposed revision to the 2020 RVO, we have serious concerns about EPA\u2019s questionable use of its \u2018reset\u2019 authority,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhile we understand EPA has a statutory obligation to consider resetting future RFS volumes when certain thresholds are met, it does not appear that Congress intended for EPA to use its reset authority for the purpose of retroactively addressing unforeseen market anomalies like COVID or weather-related disasters.\u201dThe American Coalition for Ethanol is encouraging the EPA to revise its RFS proposal to support the statute and the nation\u2019s decarbonization goals.Testimony offered by Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE, highlights how refiners lull EPA into helping them escape their legal responsibility to blend increasing volumes of renewable fuel. When viewed in isolation, certain provisions in the proposal are a positive shift away from EPA\u2019s prior mismanagement of the RFS, but the proposal in totality neglects to emphasize the role grain-based ethanol can play in helping meet the administration\u2019s decarbonization goals, according to ACE.ACE also applauded EPA\u2019s proposed a statutory 15 billion gallons for 2022 and the agency\u2019s plan to remedy the 500 million gallons in remanded volume by the DC Circuit Court in 2017. However, ACE strongly opposes EPA\u2019s proposal to retroactively waive 2020 volumes and reduce 2021 volumes. As currently drafted, the proposal does not guarantee 15 billion gallons of low carbon ethanol will be used in 2022, the group said.\u201c\u2026 EPA\u2019s ongoing obsession with maximum compliance flexibility for refiners means excess RINs can be used to meet future obligations instead of the physical blending of E15 and higher blends,\u201d Jennings stated in his testimony.The testimony also notes the legal dubiousness of retroactively and gratuitously reducing 2020 volumes below actual use. \u201cThis approach essentially shifts more of the pandemic burden from refiners to ethanol producers and farmers by allowing gallons already sold to be counted against 2022 volumes,\u201d Jennings explained.Growth Energy said the proposed RVOs would undercut blending requirements for 2021 and criticized the agency\u2019s plan to retroactively reduce the 2020 RVO.\u201cDuring the previous administration, the small refinery exemption program undercut the goals of the RFS, preventing EPA from ensuring the RVO was met each year,\u201d said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. \u201cWe appreciate the agency\u2019s work to end this abuse and return to a true implied conventional volume of 15 billion gallons in 2022, along with promoting strong growth in advanced biofuels. We are also pleased that the agency has finally proposed to restore the first 250 million gallons illegally waived in the 2016 RVO with a commitment\u00a0on\u00a0the second 250 million gallons for 2023.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEPA\u2019s proposal, however, has some serious flaws that need to be addressed. It sets an extremely troubling precedent of revising finalized volumes for 2020 and back-setting volumes for 2021 rather than driving growth in renewable fuels,\u201d Skor continued. \u201cThe proposed retroactive cuts to 2020 exceed EPA\u2019s legal authority, and negatively impact the entire agriculture and fuel supply chains.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cEPA should return integrity to the RFS program and remove hurdles to the use of higher biofuel blends as follows:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cFirst, leave 2020 RVOs as finalized in 2019, set the conventional 2021 and 2022 RVOs in line with the statute, and finalize the rulemaking as expeditiously as possible,\u201d she added.\u201cNext, EPA should move quickly to finalize its proposed denial of pending small refinery exemptions.\u00a0\u201cThe Biden Administration simply cannot meet its climate goals without strong blending requirements for low-carbon biofuel. But if the administration enforces the RFS as promised, it can be a powerful tool for keeping America on the path to a net-zero emission future,\u201d Skor Said.The National Biodiesel Board welcomed the proposed growth in the 2022 RVO and urged the EPA to maintain the integrity of the RFS program and avoid further or future delays in setting annual RVOs.Donnell Rehagen, NBB's CEO, highlighted the clean fuels industry's readiness to meet higher volumes and thanked EPA for restoring improperly waived volumes from 2016. \"During these past two years, the biodiesel industry worked hard to meet Americans' growing demand for better, cleaner fuels,\" Rehagen testified. \"In 2020, the U.S. biomass-based diesel and renewable diesel market grew to 3 billion gallons \u2013 its highest volume ever \u2013 and generated more than 4.5 billion advanced biofuel credits. Through the first 11 months of 2021, the industry has maintained a sustainable production rate comparable to 2020.\"Kate Shenk, NBB's director of regulatory affairs, also welcomed proposed growth in 2022, adding, \"We want to ensure that the BBD volume is fully met each year and continues to reflect growth in biomass-based diesel production. We also hope that EPA continues to create room for growth in the overall advanced pool, since some additional advanced biofuels are co-products of biomass-based diesel.\"NBB and its members also emphasized the uncertainty created by EPA\u2019s proposed reset of 2020 volumes and proposed \u2013 rather than outright \u2013 denial of small refinery exemptions. \"Today's proposal \u2013 while positive for future years' growth \u2013 continues to undermine the industry and bow to the pressures of the refiners,\" said David Cobb, NBB's director of federal affairs. \"The fact that this proposed rule opens another comment period for SREs just adds additional delays in finalizing a rule that is already late.\"NBB further urged EPA to quickly propose 2023 RFS volumes, which were due under the statute on Nov. 30, 2021.The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association said the EPA\u2019s plan to retroactively reduce the 2020 RVO would set a dangerous precedent.Monte Shaw, executive director of the IRFA, applauded the EPA\u2019s plan to restore the 500 million gallons of conventional biofuels illegally cut from the 2016 RFS rule, but criticized the agency\u2019s proposed reduction of the 2020 RVO. \u201cOn one hand the proposed rule restores integrity of the RFS law itself, while on the other hand, the proposal would leave the annual RFS rules on shifting sand, unable to be trusted,\u201d he said.\u201cSome say I should focus on how the proposed rule gets the RFS back on track for 2022,\u201d Shaw added. \u201cReally? How would I know? Under the precedent proposed today, this rule, which will be \u2018finalized\u2019 in a few months, could be reopened in a year or two by the EPA and the RFS levels could be reduced citing \u2018reset\u2019 or \u2018set\u2019 or some other authority. If I can have no confidence in the 2020 final rule, why should I put any confidence in the proposed 2022 numbers?\u201dShaw urged the EPA to reconsider the proposed changes to the 2020 RVO. \u201cYou have the ability to set the RFS on a solid foundation going forward. Restoring the 2016 gallons is a positive step in that direction. But reopening the 2020 rule would rip apart the credibility of the RFS just like the 2016 rule,\u201d he said.Written comments on the EPA\u2019s proposed rule to set RVOs for 2020, 2021 and 2022 can be filed through Feb. 4. Additional information is available on the Federal Register .\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "RNG Energy Solutions LLC, a\u00a0New Hampshire-based developer of complex energy infrastructure projects, announced today that it has completed the development phase of the Linden Renewable Energy Project, a large organic waste anaerobic digester project located in\u00a0Linden, New Jersey. The LRE project has secured all the\u00a0City of Linden,\u00a0Union County\u00a0and New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection required permits necessary to start construction. The LRE Project will be constructed on a 21-acre site that is located in a heavily industrialized area on Tremley Point Road.\u00a0In addition, the LRE Project has received approval from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority for\u00a0$214 million\u00a0in Industrial Development Revenue Bonds and is working with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., which is serving as the Bond Underwriter. The Industrial Development Revenue Bonds transaction is expected to close in Q1 of 2022. Starwood Energy Group Global, LLC, a private investment firm that specializes in energy infrastructure investments, and RNG Energy will be committing a total of up to\u00a0$100 million\u00a0in equity.\u00a0James Potter, President of RNG Energy and Linden Renewable Energy, states: \"We have developed an exceptional project development and equity ownership team that will take this project to the next phase of completing the bond financing and starting construction shortly thereafter.\"Himanshu Saxena, CEO of Starwood Energy Group, states, \"LRE is a groundbreaking project that will provide an environmentally sustainable path to solving a growing waste disposal problem in\u00a0the United States. Furthermore, the renewable natural gas produced by LRE will enable decarbonization of the natural gas supply chain. Our investment in LRE reflects our commitment to the sustainable energy transition space and to ESG friendly investments.\"The LRE project will use proven advanced anaerobic digesters to convert organic waste into biomethane, which will be upgraded to pipeline quality standards. The renewable natural gas (RNG) will then be directed via an interconnection to Elizabethtown Gas, a subsidiary of South Jersey Industries system located near the Project site. The LRE Project design was a collaborative effort between RNG Energy, SUEZ Water Technologies & Solutions and LRE's EPC provider, Phoenix Power Group.\u00a0Darrell Jenkins, CEO of Phoenix Power Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Quanta Services Inc., states, \"We have worked on numerous successful engagements with Jim's team in the past and are enthusiastic about participating as the EPC provider. Renewable fuel production is a strategic area of excellence for\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0and we are pleased to put forward our execution capabilities in support of the RNG project.\"\u00a0 The LRE Project has also executed a long-term operations and maintenance services agreement with SUEZ Water Technologies & Solutions, who provides similar services for anaerobic digester projects and waste water treatment projects throughout the world.The LRE project is designed to receive up to 1,400 tons per day of diverted organic waste which it will process into 3,300 dekatherms per day of renewable natural gas. This is the energy equivalent of 28,400 gallons of gasoline each day. The LRE project will have a direct interconnection to Elizabethtown Gas, a subsidiary of South Jersey Industries. The Project will also produce 260 cubic yards per day of a high value soil amendment material.\u00a0Ralph Daley, senior vice president of RNG Energy confirms, \"Virtually everything we receive would have gone to a landfill and, with this project, will now be converted to a high value renewable natural gas and soil amendment. This project provides the optimized sustainable solution for managing diverted organic waste.\"The project will also use 3.2 megawatts (MW) of Bloom Energy solid oxide fuel cells to provide primary power for the facility and digester, bolster energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, and optimize power generation costs. RNG Energy and Bloom completed a separate 6MW project on Long Island in 2020.\u00a0 Potter notes, \"We are maximizing the application of every possible viable technology to provide the optimized sustainable waste management and RNG production solutions for our partners. This is what our customers expect. The LRE project will be one of the largest carbon reduction resources in the state of\u00a0New Jersey.\"Significant site work has already been completed with the elevation of the site being increased by a remarkable 7 feet and construction of 1,600 feet of new bulkhead along the Arthur Kill and Rahway Rivers.The LRE Project includes development and construction of multiple off-site food waste preprocessing and depackaging operations to be located in\u00a0New York City,\u00a0New York state\u00a0and\u00a0New Jersey.The LRE Project will provide a sustainable and competitive waste management service within a 40mile metro region with over 18 million residents. The same region has implemented aggressive organic waste diversion regulations that need a sustainable anaerobic digestion project solution. Potter notes, \"We are not aware of any project site within this proximity to\u00a0NYC\u00a0that affords the superior capacity to receive barges combined with close proximity to the I-95 transportation corridor. These optimized transportation logistics make the project the preferred low carbon and low-cost provider of organic waste management services.\"\"The\u00a0City of Linden\u00a0has been a proud host community for the Project,\" states\u00a0Linden\u00a0Mayor Armstead. \"This is another in a long list of renewable energy projects that the City has completed. We have supported the LRE Project throughout the development phase and we definitely appreciate the investment in our City and the hundreds of union construction jobs that come with it. This is a long-term renewable and sustainable solution to waste management and we look forward to our continued association with the Project and its sponsors.\"\u00a0\u00a0"

Located in northwest Iowa, the project is known as Gevo NW Iowa RNG LLC and it is expected to produce approximately 355,000 MMBtu of RNG per year.\u201cWe\u2019re excited to get NW Iowa RNG online, right on schedule,\u201d says Chris Ryan, president and chief operating officer of Gevo, Inc. \u201cOur team here has done a terrific job, creating a facility that will become an example of how renewable energy can work for years to come, and we\u2019re excited to bring our partnership with area farmers to the next stage.\u201dNW Iowa RNG fits in with Gevo\u2019s business model of exploring ways to use renewable carbon to make the most of energy opportunities by dialing in sustainability and optimizing renewable resources. Because dairy manure left in lagoons and used as fertilizer releases high levels of methane to the atmosphere, there is an opportunity to capture that methane as biogas and refine it to be used as renewable natural gas. Doing so has no impact of the fertilizer and nutrients available, yet creates more options to sustainably manage fertilizers for sustainable farming practices. That kind of smart thinking and waste reduction is a cornerstone of the circular economy at the core of Gevo\u2019s business model.As\u00a0, the RNG is expected to be sold into the California market under dispensing agreements BP has in place with Clean Energy Fuels Corp., the largest fueling infrastructure in the U.S. for RNG. The facility is expected to lead to $9 million to $16 million a year of distributions from the project expected to begin in late 2022, or early 2023 depending on the timing of the California Air Resources Board\u2019s (CARB) Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). It is anticipated that NW Iowa RNG will benefit from environmental product revenues under California\u2019s LCFS program and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard program. RNG-fueled vehicles are estimated to result in up to 95 percent lower emissions than those fueled by gasoline or diesel on a lifecycle basis, according to a\u00a0.\u201cThe farmers have demonstrated that they are willing to try something new,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cBy creating a renewable energy source that reduces the greenhouse gas footprint of agriculture while providing meaningful renewable energy where its badly needed\u2014that kind of foresight will make a difference in the long term far beyond Northwest Iowa.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0"

GBF\u2019s products are made from renewable\u00a0feedstocks\u00a0such as vegetable oils, animal oils and fat.\u00a0 The product range includes HVO Gd+, a low emission advanced HVO fuel that can be used as a direct drop-in replacement for diesel.bp\u2019s investment will support GBF\u2019s growth as it works with businesses looking to transition away from using traditional diesel fuel in their assets, such as transport vehicles, temporary generators and construction machinery. The investment in GBF will expand bp\u2019s global biofuels portfolio and its lower\u00a0carbon\u00a0solutions for U.K. customers, in line with its strategic aim of growing its\u00a0bioenergy\u00a0businesses as it transitions to become an integrated energy company.Founded in 2013, GBF is the U.K.\u2019s largest provider of HVO, having delivered over 55 million liters of HVO products to the U.K. market over the past two years. HVO Gd+, which includes GBF\u2019s additives, can be used in diesel engines without the need for modifications or\u00a0capital expenditure. HVOs have the potential to play an important part in supporting lifecycle emission reductions in many sectors, providing a commercially viable decarbonization option for fleet owners, construction companies and vessel operators as HVOs are a drop-in replacement fuel.\u201cWe are delighted to be working with Green Biofuels, who are at the forefront of HVO supply in the U.K. market, providing their customers with solutions to help them take steps to decarbonize today. We look forward to supporting their continuing growth and working together on these immediately available alternatives. This investment further expands our biofuels portfolio, as we transition to become an integrated energy company.\u201dBy using HVO fuels, operators of diesel engines typically save lifecycle greenhouse\u00a0gas\u00a0emissions by 87 percent\u00a0and additionally improve local air quality.\u00a0 In-field and controlled environment independent tests have shown that compared to standard diesel emissions, HVO Gd+, which is often made from waste products, achieves up to 85 percent reductions of particulates and up to 30 percent reductions of\u00a0nitrogen oxides\u00a0emissions.Sven Boss-Walker,\u00a0SVP\u00a0refining\u00a0& products trading at bp, said, \u201cWe are delighted to be working with Green\u00a0Biofuels, who are at the forefront of HVO supply in the U.K. market, providing their customers with solutions to help them take steps to\u00a0decarbonize\u00a0today. We look forward to supporting their continuing growth and working together on these immediately available alternatives. This investment further expands our biofuels portfolio, as we transition to become an integrated energy company.\u201dWilliam Tebbit, CEO of Green Biofuels, said, \u201cOur mission is to support the net zero\u00a0energy transition\u00a0by providing an immediate solution that makes a difference to\u00a0carbon\u00a0and air pollution emissions today. Our fuels provide businesses the time to transition to new technologies when they are proven both economically and operationally. We are proud to be partnering with a company like bp, which recognizes the urgency of making positive changes now.\u201d \u00a0 This investment is another example of bp\u2019s work to help decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors. In December 2021 bp announced it had taken a stake in Gasrec - the U.K.\u2019s largest dual provider of bio-liquified natural gas (LNG) and bio-compressed natural gas (CNG) to the heavy goods vehicles industry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "The U.S. EPA released a final rule on Jan. 28 extending and modifying certain Renewable Fuel Standard compliance deadlines. Representatives of the biofuels industry are criticizing the EPA\u2019s actions and calling for the agency to get the RFS back on track.The rule extends the RFS compliance deadline for the 2109 compliance year for small refineries only. The new 2019 compliance deadline for small refineries will be the next quarterly reporting deadline after the effective date of the 2021 RFS standards.The rule extends the 2020, 2021 and 2022 compliance deadlines for all parties, with the 2020 compliance deadline set at the next quarterly reporting deadline after the 2019 compliance deadline for small refineries. The 2021 compliance deadline will be the next quarterly reporting deadline after the 2020 compliance deadline. The rule sets the 2022 compliance deadline at the next quarterly reporting deadline after either the effective date of the 2023 RFS standards or the 2021 compliance deadline, whichever is later.For compliance years 2019-2022, the rule extends the associated attest engagement reporting deadlines to the next June 1 attest engagement reporting deadline after the applicable 2019-2022 compliance deadline.For compliance years 2023 and later, the EPA has changed the way RFS compliance and attest engagement report deadlines are set. According to the agency, the annual compliance reporting deadline will be set at the latest date of three options, including March 31 of the subsequent calendar year, the next quarterly reporting deadline after the effective date of the final rule establishing the subsequent compliance year\u2019s RFS standards, or the next quarterly reporting deadline after the annual compliance reporting deadline for the prior compliance year. The annual attest engagement reporting deadline will be set the latest date of two options, either June 1 of the subsequent calendar year or the next June 1 attest engagement reporting deadline after the annual compliance reporting deadline.According to the EPA, the deadline changes \u201cwill help ensure that obligated parties are positioned to fully comply with their RFS obligations by ensuring that each year\u2019s compliance deadline falls after the standards for the subsequent compliance year are known.\u201d The agency also said its new approach to deadlines for 2023 and later compliance years will avoid the agency from \u201chaving to repeatedly extend compliance deadlines for obligated parties should promulgation of the subsequent year\u2019s standards be delayed.\u201dGrowth Energy has criticized the compliance deadline delays and is calling on the EPA to get the RFS back on track. \u201cDelaying compliance deadlines is completely contradictory to efforts to lower rising gas prices and increase the use of cleaner, lower-carbon fuels,\u201d said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. \u201cBy continuing to delay compliance deadlines, EPA is creating uncertainty in the marketplace and stunting the blending of biofuel needed to decarbonize transportation as the Renewable Fuel Standard intended.\u201cMoving ahead, it is vital for EPA to get the RFS back on track. EPA can start by making needed changes to its proposed cuts to the 2020 RVOs and low volumes for 2021,\u201d Skor continued. \u201cImportantly, EPA needs to swiftly finalize the proposed volumes for 2022. Administrator Regan has emphasized time and time again the need for transparency and certainty when it comes to the RFS. Ensuring timely compliance and finalizing strong biofuel blends can help Administrator Regan follow through on these promises and provide much needed certainty for biofuel producers.\u201dThe Renewable Fuels Association is also speaking out against the EPA\u2019s action on RFS deadlines. \u201cToday\u2019s action by EPA is very disappointing, and we are especially concerned by the new approach the agency is taking to future RFS compliance deadlines,\u201d said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. \u201cWith this final rule, EPA just gave itself the power to perpetually delay implementation of yearly RFS blending requirements and continually kick the can down the road on compliance deadlines. This is not what Congress intended, and this approach could exacerbate the uncertainty and instability around RFS implementation that was created by the past administration. Ethanol producers, farmers, fuel retailers, and refiners need and deserve certainty and predictability when it comes to RFS implementation timelines. That\u2019s why Congress put certain annual deadlines into the law for RFS implementation.\u201dAdditional information, including a full copy of the final rule, is available on the EPA\u2019s .\u00a0\u00a0"

A separate comment period on the agency\u2019s proposal to deny more than 60 small refinery exemptions (SREs) closes Feb. 7.The EPA to revise existing 2020 RVOs and set new RVOs for 2021 and 2022 on Dec. 7.For 2020, the EPA is proposing to reduce the total RVO for renewable fuel to 17.13 billion gallons, down from 20.09 billion gallons\u00a0. The nested RVO for advanced biofuel would be set at 4.63 billion gallons, down from 5.09 billion. The RVO for biomass-based diesel would be maintained at 2.43 billion gallons, while the cellulosic biofuel RVO would be set at 510 million gallons, down from 590 million gallons. The agency said it is proposing to revise 2020 RVOs to account for challenges the program and the market faced during the year, including from the COVID-19 pandemic.For 2021, the EPA is proposing to set the RVO for total renewable fuel at 18.52 billion gallons, including 5.2 billion gallons of advanced biofuel, 2.43 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel, and 620 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel. The EPA said the 2021 RVOs are being proposed at the level the agency projects the market used during the 2021 calendar year.For 2022, the EPA is proposing to set the RVO for total renewable fuel at 20.77 billion gallons, including 5.77 billion gallons of advanced biofuel, 2.76 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel, and 770 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel. The agency is also proposing to add a 250-million-gallon supplemental obligation and has stated its intent to add another 250-million-gallon supplemental obligation in 2023. The supplemental obligations would address the remand of the 2014-2016 annual rule by the D.C. Court of Appeals in Americans for Clean Energy v. EPA. The agency said spreading the obligation over two years would provide the market time to respond to the supplemental obligation.The RVO rule also includes a variety of other provisions, including language to allow for the production, transfer and use of biointermediates to generate qualifying fuel under the RFS program. In addition the proposal includes provisions to change the biomass-based diesel weighting factor from 1.50 to 1.55, changes to registration for baseline volumes, changes to attest engagements for parties owning renewable identification numbers (RINs), the treatment of confidential business information, clarifying the definition of agricultural digesters and several other changes and minor corrections.In the SRE proposal, the EPA proposes to deny more than 60 pending SREs from small refineries seeking exemptions from the RFS program for one or more compliance years between 2016 and 2021. The agency said the proposed decision results from its review of the pending SRE petitions and supporting information, its legal, technical and policy analysis of the Clean Air Act provisions related to small refineries, and its application of the holding of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Renewable Fuels Association et al. v.

The agency said the proposed decision results from its review of the pending SRE petitions and supporting information, its legal, technical and policy analysis of the Clean Air Act provisions related to small refineries, and its application of the holding of the . \u00a0A total of , with five SRE petitions pending for compliance year 2021, 30 SRE petitions pending for compliance year 2020, 29 SRE petitions pending for compliance year 2019, three SRE petitions pending for compliance year 2018, one SRE petition pending for compliance year 2017, and one SRE petition pending for compliance year 2016.The Renewable Fuels Association on Feb. 7 expressed strong support for the agency\u2019s proposed action, noting it would restore confidence in the RFS and ensure that SRE program complies with the Tenth Circuit Court\u2019s 2020 decision moving forward.\u201cEPA\u2019s proposed decision is consistent with the statute and with EPA\u2019s repeated determinations that small refineries pass through the cost of RFS compliance to the wholesale prices of their products and therefore do not face disproportionate economic hardship,\u201d wrote Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA in . \u201cWhen finalized, the proposed approach will restore confidence in the RFS program, which in turn will stimulate the increased investment in renewable fuel production that Congress sought to encourage.\u201dRFA also encourages EPA to deny 31 SREs granted by the previous administration for compliance year 2018. Those exemptions were inappropriately issued in 2019 and were recently remanded to EPA by the D.C. Circuit following a legal challenge led by RFA.\u00a0Cooper noted that the congressional goals of enhanced energy security and greenhouse gas emissions reduction have been undermined over the past several years due to the massive increase in SREs. \u201cAmerica\u2019s biofuel producers and farmers have been forced to pay the price\u2014the uncertainty and market instability caused by the surge of exemptions have left them unable to fully benefit from a program intended to increase demand for their products,\u201d he wrote.The American Coalition for Ethanol is also speaking out in support of EPA\u2019s SRE proposal in  submitted to the agency. \u201cACE strongly supports EPA\u2019s proposed decision to deny all pending SRE petitions by finding the petitioning refineries do not face disproportionate economic hardship (DEH) caused by compliance with their RFS obligations,\u201d wrote Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE.ACE\u2019s comments provide background on the litigation that compels EPA to deny the pending SREs, including precedent established by the Tenth Circuit Court in\u00a0which ACE was a petitioner on, and subsequent decision by the Supreme Court in . EPA\u2019s proposed denial of all pending SRE petitions complies with the Tenth Circuit Court ruling in that: 1) The cause of refinery \u201chardship\u201d must be the RFS, rather than general economic factors; and 2) EPA\u2019s determination that RFS compliance costs are essentially a pass through that are not ultimately born by refiners prevents RIN prices from being used to justify waivers.ACE is also encouraged EPA proposed to evaluate future SRE petitions based on these two restraints.Clean Fuels Alliance America also supports the EPA\u2019s SRE proposal. \u201cClean Fuels supports EPA\u2019s proposal to deny 65 pending small-refinery exemption petitions and requests that EPA also deny the 36 small-refinery exemptions\u201431 of which were originally granted\u2014for 2018,\u201d wrote Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs at Clean Fuels. The 36 additional petitions pending before the agency are those remanded by order of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in response to EPA\u2019s motion in\u00a0\u00a0and consolidated cases.Clean Fuels estimates that the 2018 exemptions reduced demand for biodiesel and renewable diesel by 190 million gallons. Overall, the exemptions that EPA granted beginning in 2017 impacted 550 million gallons of biomass-based diesel, resulting in 5.2 million metric tons of additional greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cIf EPA were to grant the pending 2019 small refinery exemptions, we estimate that biodiesel and renewable diesel will experience a future market loss of approximately 200 million gallons, resulting in 1.9 million MT of GHG emissions in the atmosphere that could have otherwise been avoided,\u201d Kovarik continued.\u201cEPA\u2019s denial of pending small refinery exemptions is not just appropriate, but required,\u201d Kovarik added. \u201cClean Fuels and its members appreciate the administration\u2019s commitment to getting the RFS back on track. We urge EPA to finalize the volumes quickly, account for small refinery exemptions fairly, and grow the market for biofuels through a timely rule for 2023 and beyond.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "Representatives of the U.S. biofuels industry on Feb. 4 called on the U.S. EPA to abandon plans to reduce the 2020 Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligation (RVO) and urged the agency to set strong RVOs for 2021 and 2022.A variety of groups, including those representing the ethanol industry, renewable natural gas (RNG) industry, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers were among those who filed public comments regarding the agency\u2019s proposed rule to revise the existing 2020 RVO and set the long-overdue RVOs for 2021 and 2022.The EPA  on Dec. 7, along with a separate proposed action in which the agency proposes to deny more than 60 pending small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions. The comment period on the RVO proposed rule closed Feb. 4, while the comment period on the proposed SRE actions is open though Feb. 7.For 2020, the EPA is proposing to reduce the total RVO for renewable fuel to 17.13 billion gallons, down from 20.09 billion gallons\u00a0. The nested RVO for advanced biofuel would be set at 4.63 billion gallons, down from 5.09 billion. The RVO for biomass-based diesel would be maintained at 2.43 billion gallons, while the cellulosic biofuel RVO would be set at 510 million gallons, down from 590 million gallons. The agency said it is proposing to revise 2020 RVOs to account for challenges the program and the market faced during the year, including from the COVID-19 pandemic.For 2021, the EPA is proposing to set the RVO for total renewable fuel at 18.52 billion gallons, including 5.2 billion gallons of advanced biofuel, 2.43 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel, and 620 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel. The EPA said the 2021 RVOs are being proposed at the level the agency projects the market will use by the end of this year.For 2022, the EPA is proposing to set the RVO for total renewable fuel at 20.77 billion gallons, including 5.77 billion gallons of advanced biofuel, 2.76 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel, and 770 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel. The agency is also proposing to add a 250-million-gallon supplemental obligation and has stated its intent to add another 250-million-gallon supplemental obligation in 2023. The supplemental obligations would address the remand of the 2014-2016 annual rule by the D.C. Court of Appeals in Americans for Clean Energy v. EPA. The agency said spreading the obligation over two years would provide the market time to respond to the supplemental obligation.In its comments, the Renewable Fuels Association indicated strong support for the proposed 2022 RVO but said the EPA should increase the proposed 2021 RVO to set the 2021 requirement for conventional renewable fuels at the statutory target of 15 billion gallons\u2014up from the 13.32 billion gallons as currently proposed. The RFA also stressed the need for the EPA to abandon plans to retroactively reduce the existing 2020 RVO.In his comments, Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA, wrote that the organization is \u201cstrongly supportive of the proposed volumes for 2022 for all categories of renewable fuel,\u201d but noted that ethanol producers are \u201cvery troubled by EPA\u2019s questionable proposed use of its \u2018reset\u2019 authority to reopen the 2020 RVO.\u201d According to Cooper, retroactively revising the 2020 RVO \u201c\u2026would set a dangerous precedent and contradict the agency\u2019s long-held position that it does not have the authority to retroactively adjust RFS standards once finalized.\u201dRFA\u2019s comments also express support for EPA\u2019s proposal to restore 500 million gallons of illegally waived RFS requirements from the 2016 RVO, as ordered by the D.C. Circuit Court in the  case, calling EPA\u2019s plan \u201creasonable and fair.\u201dThe American Coalition for Ethanol also warned of the danger posed by EPA\u2019s plan to retroactively reduce the 2020 RVO and called on the EPA to increase the proposed 2021 RVO and finalize the 2022 RVO as proposed.Without corrections for the 2020 and 2021 compliance years, EPA may merely maintain a 2022 statutory volume of 15 billion gallons on paper, Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE. He wrote that if the proposed cuts for 2020 and 2021 are finalized it \u201c\u2026will mean refiners will have amassed a stockpile of carryover RINs with which to meet a 15-billion-gallon implied conventional biofuel volume for 2022 as opposed to blending physical gallons of E15 and higher ethanol blends.\u201dJennings also encouraged the EPA to proactively consider regulatory relief to ensure year-round market access for E15 and urged the agency to replace its badly outdated internal biofuel greenhouse gas (GHG) modeling tool with the latest version of the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s GREET model.In addition, Jennings informed EPA of the first-of-its-kind  ACE and several partners were awarded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture last year to help establish a protocol for ethanol producers and farmers to document the low carbon benefits of certain farming practices and offered praise to USDA Secretary Vilsack for his visionary efforts to establish a new  to scale the deployment of climate-smart farming practices and demonstrate their link to reducing GHG emissions from products such as ethanol.The Coalition for Renewable Natural Gas (RNG Coalition) expressed support for the cellulosic targets included in the proposed 2021 and 2022 RVOs but called on the EPA to enforce the existing 2020 RVOs immediately.\"EPA\u2019s continued support for the expanded production and use of RNG is much appreciated,\u201d wrote Johannes Escudero, founder and CEO of the RNG Coalition. \u201cThe proposed RFS volume requirements providing for a\u00a051 percent increase in the program\u2019s cellulosic biofuel target between 2020 and 2022 is welcomed, and we urge issuing these standards as soon as possible. We also ask that the current 2020 standards be enforced immediately.\"\u201cThe RFS has been a key policy driver and remains critical to the growth of renewable natural gas, including to help decarbonize our medium- and heavy duty transport sector. We are ready to provide increasing volumes of\u00a0domestic, cellulosic biofuels for years to come,\u201d Escudero added.Business aviation groups have also weighed in on the EPA\u2019s proposal, calling on the agency to support the development of SAF through the RFS. General Aviation Manufacturers Association, Helicopter Association International, National Air Transportation Association, and National Business Aviation Association, filed comments on behalf of the Business Aviation Coalition for Sustainable Aviation Fuel, urging the EPA to provide greater opportunities for the development of SAF as it updates the RFS.The coalition said that with the right changes, the RFS can go a long way to helping the U.S. meet the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cSAF Grand Challenge\u201d goal of bringing 3 billion gallons of SAF to the market per year by 2030.The SAF coalition is asking the EPA to expand the list of eligible feedstocks, approve new process technologies and biointermediate opportunities and ensure that RVOs for advanced biofuels are set at levels that will allow grater supplies of those fuels. Specifically, the comments urge the EPA to ensure municipal solid waste (MSW) and woody biomass are included in the definition of biointermediates.\u201cWe hope EPA and this administration recognize the opportunity for SAF moving forward as part of the RFS program,\u201d the SAF coalition wrote. \u201cThe growth in SAF will not happen if EPA does not responsibly improve the regulatory structure of the RFS \u2014 by finalizing biointermediates, by updating the opportunities for both feedstocks and technologies, and by increasing the RVO volumes accordingly.\u201dThe Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and Iowa Corn also addressed EPA\u2019s plan to retroactively reduce the 2020 RVO in joint comments filed with the agency. The groups\u2019 comments highlight EPA\u2019s reasoning that the 2020 RVOs projected for the first time that the agency would grant a large number of SREs for the compliance year. \u201cGiven the potential impacts on EPA\u2019s SRE policy and the increased likelihood that EPA will not be granting a large number of SREs due to the 10th Circuit Court decisions in RFA and HollyFrontier, the agency argues that reconsideration is warranted given that a change in EPA\u2019s SRE policy could lead to a drawdown of carryover RINs. We disagree wholeheartedly with this line of reasoning,\u201d wrote the IRFA and Iowa Corn. \u201cFirst, even if the EPA feels this approach would be \u2018best\u2019 or \u2018fair,\u2019 if the EPA does not possess the authority to do so, then that\u2019s the end of the discussion.\u201cHowever, if after years of insisting that it does not have the authority to reopen previously finalized RFS rules, EPA now finds the authority to do so because the impact of SREs was improperly accounted for in 2020, why should we stop with reopening only the 2020 rule? To be fair, why don\u2019t we reopen the 2012-2019 finalized RVO rules as well, since NONE of those final rules properly accounted for the impact of SREs either? Why would EPA choose to reopen and retroactively reduce the one and only rule in which improper accounting of SREs benefited biofuel demand, while leaving the 2012-2019 rules in place where improper accounting of SREs destroyed over 4 billion gallons of biofuel demand? If the authority exists to go back in time to reopen a final rule, the authority must also clearly exist to reopen a closed compliance period for annual RVOs such as those in 2012-2019,\u201d IRFA and Iowa Corn continued.Growth Energy urged the EPA to quickly propose the 2020 RVO and fix the flaws in the proposed RVOs for 2020 and 2021. \u201cThe Renewable Fuel Standard was designed by Congress to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our transportation sector, improve U.S. energy security, and support American economic growth,\u201d said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. \u201cIf the Biden Administration enforces the RFS as previously promised, the RFS can be an even more powerful weapon in the fight against climate change, improving air quality, and addressing environmental justice concerns. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cEPA\u2019s proposal includes a number of forward-looking actions that underscore the critical role biofuels play in decarbonizing the transportation sector,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are encouraged that EPA\u2019s proposal for 2022 RVOs would place the RFS program back on track with 15 billion gallons implied conventional ethanol requirements that account for any estimated future small refinery exemptions. We urge the EPA to finalize the 2022 proposal immediately to get these RVOs in place for this compliance year and provide biofuel producers with much needed market certainty.\u201cHowever, EPA\u2019s proposal includes some serious flaws that need to be addressed in the final rule,\u201d Skor continued. \u201cIt contains unlawful and unnecessary retroactive cuts to the 2020 RVO and includes inexcusably late volumes for 2021 that simply reflect actual production volumes rather than spur refiners to meet Congress\u2019s RFS goals. Such moves, if finalized, would create further uncertainty in the renewable fuel marketplace and undervalue biofuels as a low-carbon, homegrown fuel and its role in our nation\u2019s battle with climate change.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0In its comments, Clean Fuels Alliance America expressed concern with EPA\u2019s triggering \u201creset\u201d authority and proposals for regulating biointermediates.Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels\u2019 vice president of federal affairs, writes in the comments on the annual volumes, \u201cWe ask EPA to provide certainty to the biodiesel and renewable diesel industry, do not unlawfully use the reset authority to retroactively adjust the 2020 volumes, and be cautious of unintended consequences associated with the biointermediates provisions.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "The U.S. Energy Information Administration recently released data showing U.S. manufacturers produced approximately 750,000 tons of densified biomass fuel in September, with sales reaching 930,000 tons.The data was released as part of the December edition of EIA\u2019s Monthly Densified Biomass Fuels Report, which contains data for September. The EIA collected data from 80 operating manufacturers of densified biomass fuel to complete the report. The report does not include data on facilities with annual production capacities of less than 10,000 tons. Those smaller facilities report data annually rather than monthly.The 80 manufacturers surveyed for September had a total combined production capacity of 12.98 million tons per year and collectively had the equivalent of 2,322 full-time employees.Respondents purchased 1.46 million tons of raw biomass feedstock in September, produced 750,000 tons of densified biomass fuel and sold 930,000 tons of densified biomass fuel. Production included 150,916 tons of heating pellets and 603,432 tons of utility pellets.Domestic sales of densified biomass fuel in September reached 220,454 tons at an average price of $187.15 per ton. Exports in September reached 715,179 tons at an average price of $171.84 per ton.Inventories of premium/standard pellets fell to 254,422 tons in September, down from 269,886 tons in August. Inventories of utility pellets fell to 324,412 tons in September, down from 383,585 tons in August.Data gathered by the EIA shows that total U.S. densified biomass fuel capacity reached 13 million tons in September, with all of that capacity listed as currently operating or temporarily not in operation. Capacity included 1.98 million tons in the East, 10.2 million tons in the South, and 838,000 tons in the West.\u00a0"

    "text": "Perhaps worse than reinventing the wheel is being\u00a0to reinvent the wheel. Unfortunately, that has been a reality for many scientists working to develop catalysts used to upgrade waste or biomass resources into climate-friendly biofuels.Gathering and analyzing existing catalyst data usually means digging through stacks of journal articles, a slow and painstaking process requiring close scrutiny. It\u2019s no wonder that many scientists find it faster to start from scratch and simply measure the same data themselves. In practice, this duplication of efforts can translate into years\u2019 worth of redundant work\u2014and even millions of dollars.This is no recipe for rapidly growing the biofuel industry, a key part of ambitious targets to decarbonize aviation with net-zero and carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel.It\u2019s a practical problem that merits a practical solution: the Catalyst Property Database (CPD).First released in September 2020 with the support of the U.S. Department of Energy Bioenergy Technologies Office, the\u00a0\u00a0developed by a team at NREL led by Kurt Van Allsburg and Carrie Farberow.The tool adds to a robust portfolio of capabilities offered by the\u00a0\u00a0(ChemCatBio). ChemCatBio works to decarbonize the economy by accelerating the development of catalytic technologies that convert biomass and waste resources into renewable fuels and chemicals.The CPD advances that mission by making it faster and cheaper to identify the right catalyst formula for specific biofuel production processes. Officially open to external uploads in September 2021, the CPD stands to accelerate biofuels research even more.Here are three reasons why:Around the world, countless scientists are collaborating on needed technologies for reducing carbon emissions across the global economy. In biofuels research, that joint effort has yielded promising breakthroughs in the design of catalysts\u2014materials, often based on transition metals, that are used to speed up the conversion of biomass into biofuels.But such dramatic progress has also led to dizzying numbers of research articles. With thousands of high-quality papers published every year, each containing numerous pieces of useful data, it can be challenging to efficiently find and build on those data and insights.With the CPD, valuable data is never more than a quick search away\u2014no poring over papers required. The literature mining has already been done by the CPD, and the journal article source is just one click away when needed.The tool\u2019s clean, modern interface enables researchers to quickly filter and define research results to match their own requirements. They can search detailed metadata on catalysts directly rather than combing through journal articles. They can review relevant details, such as catalyst composition and adsorbate surface coverage, on a growing number of catalysts.Now open to the public, data uploads, as well as the breadth and detail of that data, stand to grow substantially.Simply finding a journal article with catalyst data is not enough. Scientists must also make sure its data and results are compatible with their own study, finding answers to questions such as:\u2022Were      experiments performed under similar conditions (temperature, pressure,      solvent)?\u2022Was      the same software with comparable methods used for computational results?\u2022Do      units and definitions match up?Without the CPD, those questions aren\u2019t easy to answer, making it time-consuming to use previously published data as a benchmark. The result? More time spent filtering existing data and less time studying new catalysts.The CPD standardizes catalyst data so it\u2019s accessible to any study and to any researcher. It does this through rules on uploading data, as well as standard naming practices that make search results predictable and reliable. In this way, users have more confidence in data that has already been collected. They can easily share, cite, and build upon the work of other catalyst researchers.The United States has ample supplies of renewable resources that can be upgraded into sustainable biofuels. These resources have diverse properties and chemistries. Some may have high levels of oxygen and water. Others could contain impurities, have diverse chemical functionalities, or exhibit other unique attributes.It\u2019s not surprising, then: researchers face a slow, difficult process to design catalysts that can accommodate these diverse traits.By using the CPD\u2019s growing set of catalyst data, researchers are better equipped to uncover relationships between catalyst properties and targeted catalytic reactions to:As more types of experimental and computational data are added to the CPD, it is likely that new types of relationships will be discovered. For example, researchers can use easy-to-measure results (like a chemical or physical property of a catalyst) to predict hard-to-measure reactor performance (such as catalyst activity with real biomass feeds).Scientific breakthroughs are cultivated in strong research communities where data and insights can be readily shared, scrutinized, and cited.As a virtual library designed to make catalyst data easier to find and utilize, the CPD is fertile ground for driving similar innovations in catalysis. This helps scientists focus on what\u2019s most important: developing the next generation of catalytic technologies needed to rapidly decarbonize the global economy.With upcoming expansions and future data types, NREL\u2019s team aims to deepen the CPD\u2019s practical value to the research community. These include:\u2022User      interface and search improvements\u2022More      data from the literature\u2022A      feature to convert adsorption energies between different gas-phase      references\u2022A      pilot of machine learning technologies to rapidly screen data\u2022A      dataset on reducing catalyst deactivation from contaminants and carbon      buildup.Together, these efforts support ChemCatBio\u2019s long-term vision for a powerful Catalyst Design Engine. Built on the foundation of the CPD and\u00a0, this design engine will consider all available cost and performance data to recommend new catalysts for a researcher\u2019s biofuel application.That is another step toward guiding catalyst discovery, accelerating the pace of biofuels research to build a flourishing bioeconomy, faster.\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "Valero Energy Corp. released fourth quarter financial results on Jan. 27, reporting the Diamond Green Diesel expansion project was completed ahead of schedule. The company also reported strong results for its ethanol segment.Valero\u2019s renewable diesel segment, which consists of the DGD joint venture, reported $150 million of operating income for the fourth quarter of 2021, up from $127 million during the same period of the previous year.Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 1.6 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2021, up 974,000 gallons per day when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Valero primarily attributed the higher operating income and sales volumes to the startup of the DGD expansion project at the company\u2019s St. Charles refinery in Norco, Louisiana, during the fourth quarter.According to Valero, that expansion project at\u2014referred to as DGD 2\u2014commenced operations during the final quarter of 2021 on-budget and ahead of schedule. The expansion project was designed to boost production capacity at the site by 400 MMgy, bringing total capacity at the St. Charles facility to 690 MMgy of renewable diesel and 30 MMgy of renewable naphtha. Due to process and improvement and optimization, the expansion project actually boosted production capacity by 410 MMgy with the St. Charles facility now able to produce 700 MMgy of renewable diesel.DGD is also working to develop a renewable diesel plant at Valero\u2019s Port Arthur refinery in Texas, referred to as DGD 3. Development of that facility, which is expected to have a renewable diesel production capacity of 470 MMgy, is also progressing ahead of schedule and is now expected to commence operations in the first quarter of 2023. Once operational, that facility will boost DGD\u2019s total production capacity to 1.2 billion gallons per year of renewable diesel and 50 MMgy of renewable naphtha.Valero\u2019s ethanol segment reported $474 million of operating income for the fourth quarter of last year, up from $15 million during the same period of 2020. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.4 million gallons per day for the fourth quarter, 278,000 gallons per day higher than in the same period of the previous year. The company primarily attributed the growth in operating income to higher ethanol product prices.Valero reported that the large-scale carbon sequestration project under development by Black Rock and Navigator is progressing on scheduled and still expected to begin startup activities in late 2024. Valero is expected to be the anchor shipper of carbon dioxide, with eight of its ethanol plants connected to the system. The carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) project is expected to lower the carbon intensity (CI) score of ethanol produced at those eight plants, resulting in higher product margin.Moving into 2022, Homer Bhullar, vice president of investor relations and finance at Valero, said the company expects full-year sales volumes for renewable diesel to be approximately 700 million gallons with operating expenses of approximately 45 cents per gallon. The ethanol segment is expected to produce 4.2 million gallons per day with operating expenses at 44 cents per gallon.\u00a0"

    "text": "Today, LanzaJet, a sustainable fuels technology company and renewable fuels producer, announced it has secured financing for its Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Soperton, Georgia, through the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund. The Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund has made a $50 million investment to support the construction of LanzaJet\u2019s (and the world\u2019s) first alcohol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production plant. The innovative structure of Microsoft\u2019s financing will enable LanzaJet to bring lower-cost sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel to the global market.LanzaJet is dedicated to accelerating the energy transition in sectors where decarbonization is hard, such as aviation. LanzaJet produces SAF and renewable diesel from low-carbon, sustainable ethanol sources. This investment also creates the opportunity for LanzaJet and the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund to work together in enabling LanzaJet, through the Freedom Pines Fuels plant, to catalyze the market for 2\u00a0generation, waste-based ethanol feedstock, demonstrating clear demand signals for ethanol that can achieve greater carbon reductions.The construction of Freedom Pines Fuels is progressing as planned, even with supply chain, manufacturing, and labor shortages impacting the global economy. Fabrication of the plant is well underway; some modules are already completed and final site engineering is nearing completion. The LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels plant is expected to achieve mechanical completion this year and begin producing 10 million gallons of SAF and renewable diesel per year from sustainable ethanol, including from waste-based feedstocks, in 2023.The investment was made as part of Microsoft\u2019s efforts to achieve its 2030 goal of becoming carbon negative and advancing a net-zero economy. It also allows Microsoft to access sustainable, renewable diesel for its data centers to enable Microsoft to further achieve its net-zero goals.Demand for sustainable fuels is increasing, and governments like those in the United States and the United Kingdom are leading the transition by encouraging sustainable fuel production. The Biden administration set a goal for achieving net-zero aviation emissions by 2050, with the E.U. wanting to increase the amount of SAF blended to 63% by 2050. In September of 2021, the White House announced a target of 3 billion gallons of SAF produced per year by 2030. As part of that announcement, LanzaJet shared it would strive to achieve 1B gallons of SAF production in the US by 2030, significantly supporting US ambitions.Private sector investment and government support are crucial to enabling the development and scale-up of new technologies to curb carbon emissions as the world tackles climate change. The collaboration between LanzaJet and the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund demonstrates that such an innovative investment approach breaks down barriers by deploying new technologies, improves our nation\u2019s infrastructure, and creates new economic opportunities in rural communities. The development of LanzaJet\u2019s Freedom Pines Fuels plant is also supported by funding from the U.S. Department of Energy Bioenergy Technologies Office.LanzaJet continues to work with its founding investors to scale up the production of sustainable fuels to meet global demand and to enable the energy transition underway. Microsoft\u2019s financial support of LanzaJet joins other LanzaJet funders including LanzaTech, Inc., Suncor Energy Inc., Mitsui & Co., Ltd., British Airways, Shell, and All Nippon Airways \u2013 all who are working together to catalyze and build a new global market for sustainable fuels.Jimmy Samartzis, LanzaJet CEO, said, \u201cWe know that creating the change which our world desperately needs requires perseverance, innovation, and like-minded partnerships. We are thrilled to bring on Microsoft and its Climate Innovation Fund to help us build our first-of-its-kind sustainable fuels plant in Georgia. The partnership with Microsoft is more than just financing \u2013 it advances our work towards net zero fuels, it enables lower-cost sustainable fuels into the market, and it supports the urgency to have real, proven technologies scale-up and deploy.\u201d\u201cWe set a bold ambition to support the White House with a goal of 1 billion gallons of sustainable fuels by 2030. With Microsoft\u2019s support, this first plant significantly expands the production of sustainable fuels in the US, establishes Georgia as a leader in clean tech, and is the foundation for us as the first alcohol-to-jet sustainable fuels producer, and as a blueprint for the commercial plants we\u2019re developing globally.\u201dBrandon Middaugh of Microsoft\u2019s Climate Innovation Fund said, \u201cWith this investment, we support LanzaJet in creating new pathways to help companies across industries achieve net-zero carbon through the use of sustainable fuels. Decarbonizing hard to abate industries and technologies will be essential to achieving our carbon reduction goals by 2030. We look forward to working with LanzaJet to accelerate the global development and deployment of high-quality, sustainable fuels technologies.\u201dGeorgia Gov. Brian P. Kemp said, \u201cLanzaJet is adding to Georgia\u2019s growing sustainability ecosystem with the development of their aviation fuel and renewable diesel products,\u201d said Georgia Governor Brian P. Kemp. \u201cWe congratulate LanzaJet, Microsoft, Soperton, and Treutlen County on this innovative opportunity. We\u2019re proud that they\u2019re growing in Georgia\u2019s pro-business environment, and we look forward to working with them to support their production goals in the future.\u201dSen. Jon Ossoff (Georgia), said, \u201cThis is good news for Georgia. My vision remains that Georgia should lead the nation in clean energy and renewable energy technology \u2014 including sustainable aviation fuels. I brought the Secretary of Energy to visit the LanzaJet site last year, and I will continue working to promote clean energy technology and create Georgia jobs.\u201dRep. Rick Allen (GA-12), said, \u201cThis is great news for Georgia\u2019s 12th District as it will enable continued investment and workforce development in Soperton.

    "text": "North Fork Community Power will soon commission and utilize advanced gasification technology from EQTEC to convert forest stewardship residues into renewable electricity, heat and biochar\u2014a solid carbon byproduct with applications in agriculture and water filtration that sequesters carbon for centuries.The climate action-oriented waste-to-energy project is aligned with state and international net zero targets and in support of circular economy principles. This positive climate action is newly rewarded with carbon removal credits by Carbonfuture through its platform and marketplace. The project is the first forest biomass plant in California to join the scheme.Catastrophic wildfires in California have made clear the urgency of forest management efforts that reduce risk and improve forest health. NFCP, located in North Fork, California, is a forest-based biomass gasification plant that will utilize sustainable local forest biomass as well as fire threat reduction activities from the Sierra and Yosemite National Forest areas which will benefit local communities.The project is located on the site of an abandoned sawmill from the 1990s, bringing back sustainable jobs to this rural community in the Sierra Nevada. The project originated by the North Fork Community Development Council as a way to both steward the environment and promote economic redevelopment in the wake of the sawmill closing.Thanks to the proprietary Advanced Gasification Technology developed and supplied by EQTEC, which is also a material capital investor in the North Fork project, the process does not involve burning or combusting the wood and so the CO2 does not go up a stack. The waste wood is transformed through EQTEC\u2019s patented process, reduced and left in solid form as pure carbon as it is converted into a hydrogen-rich synthesis gas \u2018syngas\u2019. The process will generate 2 MWe of renewable electricity and biochar. Once produced, biochar is sold mostly to farms in California\u2019s Central Valley to improve water efficiency, nutrient conservation, beneficial microbial composition, and overall quantity of stable organic matter. As the carbon remains in the soil permanently, these positive characteristics are important for its carbon sequestration ability as well as ecosystem benefits. The produced biochar will help sequester 20,000t CO2 equivalent over the next 5 years.Carbonfuture\u2019s fully digital platform is used to guarantee the secure and stringent documentation of all climate-preserving activities generated in this project. The company issues removal credits for carbon sequestration services through biochar, such as the one provided in this triple-bottom-line approach. Focusing on solid climate performance, Carbonfuture uses a defensively quantified carbon sink value, resulting in high-quality, long-term and scientifically verified credits. To support the integrity of the credits even further, tamper-proof, digital tracking based on an innovative and low-energy blockchain is implemented. The use of this technology not only enables unique \u201ccredit-to-cradle cradle look-through\u201d but also eliminates the possibility of double-counting.EQTEC CEO David Palumbo said, \u201cI\u2019m very pleased that our partnership in North Fork is now even more compelling by working with Carbonfuture. Once operational, the plant at North Fork will service the local community by demonstrating a better way to use forestry waste that would otherwise pose a fire risk and to both produce biochar for watershed protection, carbon sequestration and soil enrichment, as well as use the syngas produced from the wood as a fuel to produce electricity.\u201dPhoenix Energy CEO, Gregory Stangl, said, \u201cThis project is so impactful because it provides California with carbon negative, 24/7 renewable power, created from a unique sustainable waste-to-energy process and at the same time it reduces catastrophic wildfire risk and returns lost jobs to a struggling Sierra Nevada community.\u201dCarbonfuture co-founder, Andreas Hoelzl, said, \u00a0\u201cThe North Fork project is a unique collaboration that showcases that triple bottom line projects can be accomplished by the collaboration of the right parties, spanning development, investment and technology innovation. Carbonfuture is really happy to help to support and remunerate the climate service of the project and to provide our carbon removal credit customers with high-quality, impactful credits.\u201d\u00a0"

The USDA said the payments to biofuel producers will support the maintenance and viability of a significant market for agricultural producers of products, such as corn, soybeans or biomass, that supply biofuel production. Payments awarded to biofuel producers under the program will be based upon the volume of market loss the biofuel producer experienced in calendar year 2020. According to the notice, a producer\u2019s volume of market loss will be calculated by comparing the amount of fuel they produced in calendar year 2020 to the amount of fuel produced in 2019. Eligible gallons of biofuel produced by the eligible producer in 2020 to meet required contractual commitments resulting in a gross profit loss will be deducted from 2020 production by the agency\u2019s calculation of program payments, the USDA said in the notice. Quantities of gaseous biofuel will be converted into gallons based on the British thermal unit equivalent of 1 gallon biodiesel using factors published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.The notice explains that the payments will be based on a fixed amount per gallon for all eligible producers. That fixed amount per gallon will be calculated by diving the amount of program funding available by the total volume of market loss reported by eligible program applicants.Applications for the Biofuel Producer Program must be filed by Feb. 11, 2022.

At that time, the state said Strategic Biofuels was completing feasibility and financing phases for the project and was expected to make a final investment decision by late 2022.The proposed project is also expected to feature a carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) component to enable the production of carbon-negative fuel. A , according to Strategic Biofuels.The $15 million infrastructure improvement grant was awarded through the Louisiana Port Construction and Development Priority Program, which is administrated by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development. The funds will support a road upgrade, the development of a 37-car rail spur to allow access to the Union Pacific mainline that borders the plant site, and construction of a rail overpass.\u201cThe infrastructure improvement grant represents a major advancement for the Port of Columbia and Caldwell Parish,\u201d said Greg Richardson, port director. \u201cIt allows the Port to improve the services it can offer and ultimately improve revenues. Because of the grant\u2019s potential impact, the Port engaged Gary LaGrange,longtime Director of the Port of New Orleans, to help us navigate the grant application process. During Gary\u2019s 15-year tenure with the Port of New Orleans, he was responsible for more than $500 million in infrastructure improvements before he retired in 2016. Our success in securing the grant confirmed the Port Commissioners\u2019 wisdom in engaging him.\u201d\u201cWe greatly appreciate the efforts the Port has made to secure funding for infrastructure improvements,\u201d said Bob Meredith, chief operating officer of Strategic Biofuels. \u201cThe early upgrading of Riverton Camp Road coming this summer provides strong support for LGF\u2019s aggressive construction schedule. It allows us to begin actual plant construction as soon as the full project funding is secured, and we expect that to be in early 2023. The Port has also been a key contributor in our efforts with DOTD and Union Pacific Railroad. The strong support we\u2019ve continued to receive from Caldwell Parish confirms the wisdom of locating the plant here.\u201d\u00a0"

Inc. and Brightmark Fund Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of the global waste solutions provider Brightmark LLC \u2013 today announced plans to construct an anaerobic digestion project at Vlot Calf Ranch in Chowchilla, California.The Vlot anaerobic digestion project is anticipated to capture, clean, and convert methane from manure that would otherwise escape to the atmosphere on the Vlot Calf Ranch and dairy farm into renewable natural gas (RNG). When used in the transportation sector, renewable natural gas from dairy operations has a negative carbon intensity on a lifecycle basis under California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard. The Vlot Project is Brightmark RNG Holdings LLC\u2019s first renewable natural gas project in the state of California.\"The Vlot Project represents a major milestone for Brightmark and its RNG production efforts,\" said Bob Powell, founder and CEO of Brightmark. \"Being able to partner with Chevron and the Vlot Calf Ranch on our largest RNG project to date and first project in our home state of California represents a particular point of pride for our company and efforts.\u201d\u201cAs a California company, Chevron has provided the state\u2019s residents with affordable, reliable energy for more than 140 years,\u201d said Andy Walz, president of Americas Fuels & Lubricants for Chevron. \u201cDeveloping and delivering renewable natural gas with Brightmark and the Vlot Calf Ranch, once completed, demonstrates our commitment to working across critical sectors of the state\u2019s economy to increase the supply of fuels with a lower lifecycle carbon intensity.\u201d\"Sustainability considerations and agriculture go hand-in-hand; one cannot exist without the other,\" said Case Vlot of Vlot Calf Ranch. \"As farmers and livestock owners, we take pride in caring for our land and environment because we know that when we do that, it will in turn, take care of us and our animals. It is what farmers, ranchers and dairy farmers do. Innovation in agriculture is constant and ever-changing. This digester is another step in providing environmental benefits to our farm and surroundings. In this case, it's utilizing the manure from our cattle in an anaerobic digester that will help generate those benefits to continue our legacy in sustainability. We are looking forward to seeing this project completed.\"The project is expected to be completed in 2023. Other renewable products generated by the project include recycled water back to the farm, biofertilizer and digested dairy fiber, which can be used as cow bedding or as a peat moss substitute.\u00a0\u00a0"

Collectively, those notices describe plans for the production of nearly 800 MMgy of advanced biofuels.NCD has formed a dedicated team to collaborate on the review of the PMNs for biobased or waste-derived feedstocks used to make transportation fuel substitutes with the goal to use the best available science while creating a consistent and efficient review process. According to the EPA, NCD has developed a standardized process to review biofuel PMNs. Under that process, the same dedicated team will conduct reviews for all biofuel PMNs. NDC will also generate one report for biofuel PMNs that combines the six different risk assessments typically conducted for PMNs. For risk management actions, NDC will apply appropriate mitigation measures to address any potential for unreasonable risk identified in an efficient and consistent manner with TSCA consent orders and significant new use rules (SNURs).OCSPP will hold a for interested stakeholders in the biofuel sector. A kick-ff meeting, scheduled for Feb. 9, will provide an overview of the initiative and answer stakeholder questions. A session on Feb. 23 will focus on TSCA requirements and the PMN process, while a March 9 webinar will focus on TSCA inventory, nomenclature and Bona Fide process, a March 23 event will focus on new chemical risk assessments and applications of the tools and models, and an April 6 webinar will focus on new chemicals risk management actions, including TSCA section 5 orders and significant new use rules (SNURs).

    "text": "Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack discussed the important role biofuels and biobased manufacturing play in the rural economy and highlighted the agency\u2019s efforts to support those industries during a Jan. 20 hearing held by the House Agriculture Committee.In his opening statement, Vilsack focused on the phrase \u201can extraction economy\" and the need to create a circular economy where wealth is created and stays in rural areas. He explained that many of the raw resources produced by the ag economy are currently transported long distances, and value-added at some other location. As a result, opportunities and jobs are created in areas other than rural America. \u201cI think its going to be important to us as we look forward to try to develop what is called a circular economy, in which the wealth is created and stays in rural areas,\" he said.\u00a0Vilsack offered several examples of a circular economy, including biobased manufacturing. \u201cBiofuels is one example, but there are a multitude of ways in which we can convert agricultural waste products into a wide variety of things beyond renewable energy and fuel, to include chemicals, materials, fabrics, fibers\u2014again creating opportunities for farmers and additional income sources as well as rural jobs.\u201dHe also stressed that climate change creates an opportunity for the ag sector. \u201cAs we look at ways in which rural lands can be used to sequester carbon\u2014as we embrace climate smart agricultural practices\u2014it opens up a whole new vista of opportunity for farmers to essentially be paid for the carbon sequestration that they are currently doing and will do in the future,\u201d Vilsack said.Vilsack also field several questions related to biofuels, the Renewable Fuel Standard, E15 and electric vehicles during the hearing.Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., referenced recent media reports that the Biden administration is considering lowering its proposed 2022 renewable volume obligation (RVO) and asked Vilsack to comment on those rumors.In response, Vilsack stressed that the proposed RVO for 2022 is the highest in the history of the RFS program. He also discussed the $700 million in COVID-19 relief for biofuels and the $100 million in biofuel infrastructure funds that the USDA has announced it will distribute this year and highlighted the importance of the U.S. EPA\u2019s proposal to deny more than 65 small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions.Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., also questioned Vilsack on the importance of biofuels and the Biden administration\u2019s support for the industry.Vilsack outlined four primary benefits of the biofuels industry. He said the industry supports stability in farm income, increases jobs in rural areas, provides consumers with choice at the pump, and benefits the environment. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important for the industry to have stability,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, stability comes not just from setting a [strong RVO], but from making sure that number is real.\u201d He discussed the Trump administration\u2019s overuse of SRE waivers, noting that RVOs finalized by Trump\u2019s EPA were not real, rather they were greatly dissipated by the granting of SREs. The current administration plans to deny more than 65 pending SRE petitions, which will result in a \u201creal\u201d RVO. \u201cI think the stability is going to be very helpful to this industry,\u201d he said. \u00a0Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., said her constituents are concerned about the Biden administration\u2019s focus on electric vehicles and questioned if the administration has shown sufficient support for biofuels.In response, Vilsack reiterated the importance of the $700 million in pandemic relief and $100 million in infrastructure support that the USDA is offering to the biofuels industry, along with the impact of the EPA\u2019s decision to reign in the SRE program. He also stressed that the Biden administration has also set an ambitious goal for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). \u201cI think it\u2019s very unfair to suggest that this administration has not been supportive of the biofuel industry,\u201d he said.Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., also questioned Vilsack regarding the focus on electric vehicles. \u201cThere is a lot of conversation about electric cars,\u201d Vilsack said, but stressed that cars with internal combustion engines will continue to remain on the road for the foreseeable future and will require the use of biofuels. Liquid biofuels will also continue to be necessary for aviation and marine transport. \u201cWe won\u2019t see the elimination of [the biofuels industry]\u2014we\u2019ll see an expansion of it,\u201d Vilsack said. \u201cI\u2019m excited about this industry and think the future is bright.\u201dRep. Michelle Fischbach, R-Minn., expressed concern that the fact that biofuels reduce emissions is getting lost in the conversion on climate change, and asked about the agency\u2019s support for biofuels. \u201cI am confidence that I am one of the most ardent proponents of biofuels anywhere in this country and have been for years\u2014decades,\u201d Vilsack said in response, assuring the committee that biobased fuels remain a priority for the current administration.Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said Vilsack has long championed efforts to expand biomanufacturing and asked about the impact recently allocated funding will have that sector.Vilsack explained that a Congress allocated a relatively small amount of funds the agency in a recent infrastructure bill to look at the issue of biobased manufacturing. That funding, he said, could have a profound impact on rural America. Biobased manufacturing provides a market for a variety of agricultural waste products, Vilsack said. Those materials can be used to produce not only fuels, but also chemicals, materials, fabrics, fibers and renewable energy\u2014all of which creates a circular economy, creates new income sources for farmers, and helps avoid some of the environmental challenges associated with some ag industries. He potential, he said, is unlimited and \u201crural America is ripe for this opportunity.\u201dA full replay of the hearing is available on the House Agriculture Committee .\u00a0\u00a0"

I would particularly like to thank Tony McShane, Covanta Europe\u2019s Construction Director for setting the appropriate tone and culture at the commencement of the construction program, and this positive culture has been maintained throughout the delivery phase of the project. Finally, I would like to also thank Veolia, our principal fuel supply partner, for delivering all the waste required during the challenging Christmas period and against the backdrop of the driver shortage.\u201dThroughout the construction and commissioning phases, this project has provided employment for over 500 contracting personnel and supply chain opportunities for business locally, across the UK and internationally.The Rookery South facility now employs over 60 new personnel in full-time operational roles, with many of the positions being sourced from within 25 miles of the plant in Stewartby, Bedfordshire. In addition, operational supply chain contracts have also been awarded to local businesses in direct support of the local economy.The project has also opened its Community Trust Fund which will now provide financial support to local charities and community causes, alongside the scheme\u2019s innovative Rookery South Community Energy Initiative, which will lower the annual electricity bills for households and community assets in the vicinity of the plant.\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "Enviva Inc. on Jan. 19 announced accelerated plans to double its wood pellet production capacity and said it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a U.S.-based customer that plans to convert woody biomass supplied by Enviva into low-carbon transportation fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).Enviva did not disclose the name of the company that plans to convert its woody biomass into transportation fuels but did note that the biofuel producer is Enviva\u2019s first U.S.-based customer. The customer plans to convert Enviva\u2019s wood biomass into a drop-in replacement for crude oil used to produce aviation fuel via its refining process. Under the MOU, the two companies will co-develop a supply chain strategy for advanced low-carbon transportation fuels with a focus on the customer\u2019s operations in the U.S. Southeast and potentially California.Enviva said its current operations and numerous potential development sites in the Southeast position it to co-develop alongside the SAF refining capacity the customer intends to construct in the region. Enviva is also evaluating plans to build one or more facilities in California with the intent of utilizing low-grade wood fiber from high-hazard zones in the state.The newly announced MOU represents Enviva\u2019s second agreement related to SAF. In November, Enviva announced the singing of a 10-year take-or-pay off-take contract with an industrial customer in Europe for 60,000 metric tons per year of wood pellets to be used as feedstock for the production of SAF and other biofuels. Deliveries under the initial tranche of that contract are scheduled to begin in 2023, with volumes potentially increasing to approximately 1.2 million metric tons per year by 2027.\u201cWe are extremely excited about the growth in Enviva\u2019s business and our first MOU with a U.S. customer,\u201d said John Keppler, chairman and CEO at Enviva. \u201cEfforts around the world to decarbonize in order to meet net zero by 2050 continue to accelerate, giving companies like ours the tremendous opportunity to grow even more rapidly and expand the global supply chain as necessary to continue to facilitate the energy transition and mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions profile of hard-to-abate industries such as steel, cement, lime, and biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuels. We are very proud to now be in a position to not only export the sustainable, renewable energy and low-carbon feedstock we produce in the Southeastern United States, but to combat both climate change and devastating wildfire risks by expanding the long-term contracted use of our products and growing our customer and production footprint right here at home in the broader U.S.\u201dEnviva also announced plans to double its production capacity over the next five years, from its current capacity 6.2 million metric tons per year to approximately 13 million metric tons per year. The company plans to continue utilizing its \u201cbuild and copy\u201d approach to plant design while increasing the nameplate production capacity of its new plans to approximately 1.1 million metric tons per year, up approximately 45 percent when compared to its previous standard of 750,000 metric tons per year. To aid in the rapid expansion, Enviva said it broadening and deepening its development capabilities and leveraging relationships with key equipment suppliers and construction partners to enable it to build and commission two plants per year, up from its historical rate of one plant per year.The new production capacity is expected to include a third wood pellet plant in its Pascagoula cluster. The first two facilities in that cluster\u2014the Lucedale, Mississippi, and Epes, Alabama, plants\u2014are already under development. The Lucedale facility is expected to ramp up production this year to 750,000 metric tons per year, expanding capacity to approximately 1 million metric tons per year in 2023. Construction on the Epes plant is expected to begin during the first half of 2022.In addition to the Pascagoula cluster, Enviva said it is also planning to develop facilities in the Savannah and mid-Atlantic regions. In total, the company plans to put six plants into service over the next five years.A full copy of the Enviva\u2019s announcement is available on the company\u2019s .\u00a0"

    "text": "Honeywell today announced that a CVR Energy Inc. subsidiary has selected Honeywell UOP Ecofining technology to study conversion of seed oils, tallow and white/yellow greases into renewable diesel fuel at its facility in Coffeyville, Kansas. CVR Energy is currently evaluating the conversion of an existing hydroprocessing unit at the plant to a single-stage Ecofining unit for the production of approximately 11,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel and jet fuels.Honeywell\u2019s single-stage\u00a0Ecofining process is a fast-to-market, capital efficient solution ideal for repurposing hydroprocessing units to produce high yields of renewable diesel. The process produces renewable diesel fuel, which has chemically substantially similar molecules to petroleum-based diesel and jet and can be used as a drop-in replacement with no engine modifications.Depending on feedstock choice, renewable diesel also features a 50-to-80-percent lifecycle reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional diesel.\u00a0\u201cAs we previously announced, CVR Energy is laser focused on the development of its renewable initiatives,\u201d said Dave Lamp, president and CEO of CVR Energy. \u201cAdding Ecofining technology to our Coffeyville refinery could complement the renewable diesel project in process at our Wynnewood refinery. These projects, combined with others under development, could help us decarbonize our operations.The new single-stage Ecofining process uses a combination of catalysts in a single operating environment to remove oxygenates and other contaminants from the feedstock, and then isomerize the feed to improve its cold-flow properties. Due to its simplified design, single-stage Ecofining technology can be put into service quickly, with lower capital expense than other designs.\u201cAs customers like CVR seek alternative uses for existing units to grow their renewable fuels production to meet sustainability goals, our single-stage Ecofining process provides an ideal, economical solution,\u201d said Ben Owens, vice president and general manager, Honeywell Sustainable Technology Solutions. \u201cWe simplified the design of our Ecofining process to help refiners to meet stricter regulations for renewable fuels production while cutting costs and minimizing space and equipment.\u201dUOP and Eni SpA jointly developed the \u00a0, which converts non-edible natural oils and animal fats to renewable diesel fuel. The Ecofining process produces diesel with a cetane value of 80, substantially higher than the 40-to-60 cetane diesel commonly used in diesel engines today. As a result, this higher-cetane diesel fuel can be blended with less expensive, low-cetane diesel to meet transportation fuel standards while providing better engine performance with fewer emissions.The Ecofining technology is used in most 100 percent-biofeed units producing renewable diesel and the only 100% production of SAF in the world today. UOP currently has licensed 24 Ecofining units in eleven countries around the world, processing 12 different types of renewable feedstocks.\u00a0recently committed to achieve carbon neutrality in its operations and facilities by 2035.\u00a0\u00a0builds on the company\u2019s track record of sharply reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of its operations and facilities as well as its decades-long history of innovation to help its customers meet their environmental and social goals. About half of Honeywell\u2019s new product introduction research and development investment is directed toward products that improve environmental and social outcomes for customers.\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": "The 2022 Iowa Renewable Fuels Summit, held Jan. 25, highlighted significant opportunities for growth driven by demand for advanced biofuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but also addressed policy and economic concerns impacting biofuel producers.Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, provided an overview of political and regulatory issues impacting the biofuels sector, stressing that Iowa\u2019s biofuel industry is \u201cfed up but fired up.\u201dThe industry entered 2021 with renewed optimism, he said. \u201cVaccines were rolling out and it felt like we were turning the corner on COVID.\u201d The Biden administration\u2019s stated commitment to biofuels and the U.S. EPA\u2019s announcement that it would rein in small refinery exemptions (SREs) added to the hopeful outlook. That optimism, however, began to fade as the year went on, Shaw said. The Delta and Omicron waves of COVID put economic recovery in question and supply chain issues are driving high inflation rates. \u201cThe RFS exemption denials did not come. The DC Circuit Court threw out year-round E15,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThe Biden Build Back Better bill rolled out with billions for electric vehicles (EVs) and nothing initially for renewables.\u201dThe EPA finally released its proposed Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations (RVOs) for 2021 and 2022 in late 2021. While the proposed RVO for 2022 is strong, Shaw called the proposed 2021 RVO disappointing and said the agency\u2019s decision to reopen, and likely reduce, the 2020 RVO is dismaying. \u201cAnd throughout the year from Washington, D.C., came an incessant drumbeat that electric vehicles were the only solution for our transportation future,\u201d he said, thanking the Iowa delegation for standing united across party lines in support of biofuels.Shaw stressed that biofuels must play a part in decarbonizing transportation, noting that the RFS is the only federal law on the books today designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation fuels.\u201cI can clearly say the state of the Iowa biofuels industry in 2022 is fed up, but fired up,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cWe are fed up at seemingly being ignored or marginalized, but we are fired up to succeed in spite of it.\u201dShaw addressed the potential that carbon capture offers to biofuel and ag prodcuers. \u201cWhen corn and soybean plants grow, they suck CO2 out of the atmosphere,\u201d he said. \u201cWith improved efficiencies at the farm and biofuel plant level, I firmly believe that one day biofuels can and will be net carbon negative. Achieving that goal will require carbon sequestration and carbon pipelines. These projects are essential to the long-term viability of biofuels. As a guy still active in my family\u2019s farming operation, I know how emotional some of these issues can be. So, I pledge to work with farmers and policymakers to ensure we have a fair and equitable path forward.\u201dRegarding the need for year-round E15, Shaw applauded Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for leading a Midwest effort to find a regional solution in the absence of federal action. \u201cThe Clean Air Act allows governors to take action to ensure the regulatory treatment for E10 and E15 is the same,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cBy exercising this authority, governors can restore year-round E15 sales for retailers and motorists. IRFA is proud to be working with Gov. Reynolds and groups in other states to push for a Midwest E15 solution.\u201dSeveral speakers at the event discussed the significant opportunity offered by rapidly expanding demand for drop-in biofuels, such as renewable diesel and SAF.Donnell Rehagen, CEO of Clean Fuels Alliance America, delivered a keynote address that discussed the substantial growth potential offered by SAF and renewable diesel. While federal policy in support of biofuels is incredibly important, Rehagen stressed that state-level policies also help to drive growth in demand for biofuels.State policies currently create markets for approximately 1.9 billion gallons of biodiesel and renewable diesel, he said. By 2030, Rehagen said state markets could drive that demand to 5.3 billion gallons, with California leading that demand at more than 3 billion gallons. Corporate policy is also expected to have a huge impact on demand for biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF moving forward, Rehagen said, as companies like Amazon and Microsoft work to reduce supply chain emissions.Steve Csonka, executive director of the Commercial Aviation Alterative Fuels Initiative, spoke about the potential of SAF during a roundtable on emerging markets. He said in the U.S. alone, the aviation industry offers a 26-billion-gallon market opportunity. Worldwide, the market for aviation fuel is nearly 100 billion gallons\u2014and that market will continue to grow. Jet fuel demand is expected to expand by 3-5 percent annually for the foreseeable future, he said, driven largely by developing economies. Increased fossil fuel consumption also means increasing GHG emissions.\u201cWe don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that allows us to curtail that other than the use of SAF,\u201d Csonka said, noting SAF is the only reasonable approach to reducing GHG emissions from the aviation sector.SAF can achieve GHG reductions of 65 percent and higher, with some technologies showing the ability to be carbon-negative. Ethanol can be used as a feedstock for SAF production, Csonka said, but stressed that ethanol used as a feedstock for SAF will need to have a low carbon index to ensure finished fuel has a carbon reduction of at least 50-60 percent.Csonka also discussed the need for SAF to be both affordable and sustainable in order for the aviation sector to truely embrace the use renewable fuels. The global aviation industry has set a goal to be net zero by 2050, with focus on the use of SAF, he said \u201cWe expect 65 percent of our reduction worldwide to come from the use of SAF,\u201d Csonka added, noting that there are interim commitments for 10 percent SAF use by 2030.The Iowa Renewable Fuels Summit also featured roundtable discussions focused reducing the carbon footprint of biofuels, renewable fuels policy and the economic outlook.The IRFA plans to post full replays of the summit presentations to its  soon.\u00a0\u00a0"

    "text": ", a pioneer in converting dairy waste into carbon-negative renewable transportation fuel and power, today announced the expansion of its dairy renewable natural gas (RNG) and electricity assets portfolio with two major acquisitions that tripled the size of its carbon-negative fuels portfolio.Amp Americas has expanded its partnership with , consolidating Generate Capital\u2019s flagship Indiana dairy RNG project assets into Amp Americas\u2019 expanding dairy RNG portfolio. Amp Americas\u2019 management team commenced development of the Indiana projects in 2012, and Amp Americas has operated and managed them on behalf of Generate Capital since June 2019. These Indiana projects consist of five digesters and two gas processing plants that capture methane from approximately 1.5 million gallons per day of dairy waste generated by 36,000 cows across nine dairies. The projects then purify and compress the methane, which otherwise would enter the atmosphere, into carbon-negative renewable transportation fuel.Amp Americas also acquired a group of RNG project assets in Idaho from Vitol Green Holdings LLC,\u00a0an affiliate of . The Idaho projects consist of three digesters at two gas processing plants and one electric power generation plant that capture methane from over 940,000 gallons of dairy waste per day generated by 36,000 cows across three dairies. The projects then purify and process this methane into carbon-negative renewable transportation fuel and power.\u00a0With these additions to Amp Americas\u2019 portfolio, the company now operates seven of the largest dairy biogas-to-transportation fuel projects in the United States and is currently producing fuel from dairy waste generated by over 100,000 cows across 20 dairies, producing carbon-negative RNG and capturing carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) and contributing to efforts to combat climate change and to improve air quality.\u201cWe have an agile structure and proven ability to finance, build, own, operate, market, and deliver renewable energy projects\u2014all under one roof,\u201d said Grant Zimmerman, CEO of Amp Americas. \u201cWe believe the strength of these acquisitions, combined with our existing asset portfolio, will enable us to continue to make meaningful contributions to the decarbonization of the transportation and agriculture sectors.\u201d\u201cAmp Americas has been a valued decarbonization partner for Generate over the last several years and we are excited to deepen our relationship with Amp Americas through our investment in the company,\u201d said John Dannan, managing director at Generate Capital. \u201cAmp Americas\u2019 scale and expertise are an attractive model for reducing methane pollution and expanding the RNG market, and we are looking forward to supporting the company\u2019s growth in the years to come.\u201dFollowing the transactions, John Dannan and Matan Friedman, Generate\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, joined Amp Americas\u2019 board of directors.\u201cAmp Americas has a long history of developing and operating on-farm dairy RNG projects,\u201d said David Finan, partner of EIV Capital LLC. \u201c\u200b\u200bFrom addressing the financial complexities of RNG development to understanding the nuances of compliance and regulatory work and creating environmental and economic opportunities for farmers and their communities, Amp Americas has demonstrated unique expertise and an ability to positively impact the industry and our planet. We are proud to partner with the company in its efforts.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

A variety of other rulemakings impacting biofuel producers are also scheduled to be taken up by federal agencies in the near-term, including those related to RFS fuel pathways, the Biopreferred program, and permitting for certain corn ethanol plants.Abstracts of the expected rulemakings are included in the White House Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Fall 2021 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, published on Dec. 10.The OMB\u2019s unified fall agenda provides expected timelines for several rulemakings already in progress, including the EPA\u2019s recently released proposed rules to set 2020, 2021 and 2022 RVOs and extend certain RFS compliance reporting deadlines, and the agency\u2019s ongoing rulemaking to revise greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions standards for model year (MY) 2023 and later light-duty vehicles.The EPA to revise 2020 RFS RVOs and set new RVOs for 2021 and 2022 on Dec. 7. \u00a0The proposed rule also updates and re-proposes a provision originally included in the long-stalled\u00a0\u00a0to allow for the production, transfer and use of biointermediates to generate qualifying fuel under the RFS program, and includes a variety of other provisions updating the RFS program. A public comment period on the rule is open through Feb. 4. The OMB\u2019s  a final rule could be released as soon as February 2022.The unified agenda also addresses the  released by EPA in mid-November that aims to further delay certain RFS compliance and attest engagement report deadlines and change the way the agency sets those deadlines moving forward, but .The EPA\u2019s final  for MY 2023 and later vehicles is currently before the end of the year, according to the OMB. Representatives of the ethanol industry have urged the EPA to address GHG reductions made possible through the use of high-octane, low-carbon renewable fuels as part of the rulemaking.According to the 2021 fall unified agenda, the EPA is currently expected to issue a . Statutory provisions of the Clean Air Act governing the RFS program provides target RVOs only through 2022. Starting in 2023, the EPA must set those volumes based on an analysis of factors specified in statute. The upcoming rulemaking will establish volume requirements beginning in 2023, according to the OMB. A final rule is currently expected to be issued in December 2022.The unified agenda also indicates that the EPA plans to issue a  focused on RFS canola oil pathways for renewable diesel, jet fuel, naphtha and liquid propane gas (LPG). An abstract published by the OMB states that the proposed rule will provide an opportunity to comment on an analysis of lifecycle GHGs associated with biofuels produced from canola oil via a hydrotreating process. A final rule is currently expected to be published in July 2022.The EPA is also set to reconsider prevention of significant deterioration (PSD), nonattainment new source review, and Title V treatment of corn milling facilities under the \u201cmajor emitting facility\u201d definition, according to the unified agenda. The OMB said the rulemaking would convene a proceeding to reconsider portions of a  that applies to nonattainment areas. A is expected to be released in February. The OMB provided no estimate of when a final rule could be issued.The USDA is also expected to issue a final rule on its Biobased Markets Program, also referred to as the BIopreferred program, in June 2022.

    "text": "Aemetis Inc., a leading producer of dairy renewable natural das (RNG) and developer of the \u201cCarbon Zero\u201d renewable jet/diesel biorefineries, announced Dec. 22 it signed a master developer agreement with the City of Riverbank to lease/purchase the 125-acre former military base in Riverbank, California, known as the Riverbank Industrial Complex.The Riverbank facility features 710,000 square feet of existing buildings, a four-mile railroad loop with 120 railcar storage capacity, and an onsite hydroelectric substation with 100 percent low carbon hydroelectric power. The site has received more than $72 million of federal funding for facility upgrades and remediation since being decommissioned as an army base.Aemetis plans to build the \u201cCarbon Zero 1\u201d sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel biorefinery at the site. The plant is designed to use hydroelectric and other renewable power available onsite to produce 90 million gallons per year of sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, and other byproducts. The plant is expected to supply the aviation and truck markets with ultra-low carbon renewable fuels to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other pollutants associated with conventional petroleum-based fuels.The Riverbank Industrial Complex was an ammunition production facility employing about 3,500 people and has been converted to civilian use, including approximately 35 companies employing around 650 people. Under the terms of the Master Developer Agreement and as the owner of the properties as parcels are transferred, Aemetis will manage current tenants, utilize existing production facilities for new tenants or as production facilities, and develop vacant portions of the site with planned renewable fuels and carbon sequestration facilities.A federal job study estimated 2,014 direct and indirect jobs will be created as a result of developing the Aemetis biofuels plant.\u201cThis project, from staff\u2019s perspective, has significant potential to create an industrial job center for not only Riverbank, but the whole region,\u201d said City Manager Sean Scully during the City Council meeting on Dec. 14\u00a0in which the agreement was unanimously approved.In mid-2018 after a competitive review process, the City of Riverbank selected Aemetis as the master developer and acquirer of the Riverbank Industrial Complex property. The City of Riverbank has managed the complex since the military leased the site to the City for conversion from military to private use.\u201cI\u2019ve often stated that the City of Riverbank should not be in the business of running the Industrial Complex,\u201d said Riverbank Mayor Richard O\u2019Brien. \u201cFinding the right entity to take over that task and come up with a deal that was good for all was at times very painful \u2013 and highly rewarding. We are truly grateful to form this partnership. There\u2019s nothing like this effort locally and this project has regional significance.\u201dThe Aemetis agreement to acquire the Riverbank Industrial Complex paves the way for a clean energy economic and environmental renaissance in the California Central Valley.The Aemetis Carbon Zero facility is designed to support almond and other orchard farmers to dispose of wood waste by converting a portion of the 3 billion pounds of annual orchard wood waste into negative carbon intensity, renewable hydrogen used in sustainable jet and renewable diesel fuel production.Aemetis has received a grant for $5 million from the California Energy Commission (CEC) for the engineering and construction of biofuels production facilities at the Riverbank site.Aemetis recently signed $2.1 billion of sustainable aviation fuel supply agreements with Delta Air Lines to supply 250 million gallons under a 10 year agreement and with American Airlines to supply 280 million gallons, for delivery to the San Francisco Airport. In addition to American, Aemetis has also signed memorandums of understanding for sustainable aviation fuel with seven other oneworld Alliance airlines.In mid-December, Aemetis announced a $3 billion, 450 million gallon, 10 year supply agreement with a large travel stop company to supply renewable diesel to California fueling locations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"
